"The Greatest Source of Power","Myutmost for his highest","""2016-06-08T10:16:04.227Z""","""2016-06-08T00:00:00.000Z""","Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do… —John 14:13\r
\r
 Am I fulfilling this ministry of intercession deep within the hidden recesses of my life? There is no trap nor any danger at all of being deceived or of showing pride in true intercession. It is a hidden ministry that brings forth fruit through which the Father is glorified. Am I allowing my spiritual life to waste away, or am I focused, bringing everything to one central point— the atonement of my Lord? Is Jesus Christ more and more dominating every interest of my life? If the central point, or the most powerful influence, of my life, is the atonement of the Lord, then every aspect of my life will bear fruit for Him.\r
However, I must take the time to realise what this central point of power is. Am I willing to give one minute out of every hour to concentrate on it? “If you abide in Me…”— that is if you continue to act, and think, and work from that central point— “you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you” (John 15:7). Am I abiding? Am I taking the time to abide? What is the greatest source of power in my life? Is it my work, service, and sacrifice for others, or is it my striving to work for God? It should be none of these— what ought to exert the greatest power in my life is the atonement of the Lord. It is not on what we spend the greatest amount of time that moulds us the most, but whatever exerts the most power over us. We must make a determination to limit and concentrate our desires and interests on the atonement by the Cross of Christ.\r
“Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do….” The disciple who abides in Jesus is the will of God, and what appears to be his free choices are actually God’s foreordained decrees. Is this mysterious? Does it appear to contradict sound logic or seem totally absurd? Yes, but what a glorious truth it is a saint of God.\r

"Come Up Higher","Wisdom for the day","""2016-06-08T10:17:32.422Z""","""2016-06-08T00:00:00.000Z""","""Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."" 2 Peter 1:4 (KJV)\r
 \r
The only way you can be on top of the world system as a believer is for you to make the decision to order your life based on the word of God. Otherwise, you will remain minced meat in the hands of the world system. Others are not going to change, but we have a power that can lift us up. We have things within us and available to us. We have a power that can silence the powers of darkness and cause us to take our portion.\r
 \r
God has called us and told us to come up higher. It is an invitation to you from God, telling you to grow up and that you can no longer remain a baby. I am calling all believers to rise up and be high-flyers. It is an invitation to leave the mundane and mediocrity. It is an invitation to shoot for excellence, to leave your footprints on the sands of time, to come up to a life of abundance and success, and to live a fulfilled life.\r
 \r
But the problem is that spiritual men and women want to live their lives in the flesh. ""For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace"" (Romans 8:6, KJV). To be carnally minded means that you are thinking like the rest of the world even though you are a spiritual person. As long as you want to dominate the material world in your flesh, you will never succeed, because there is a devil that is loosed on earth to hinder you. But God is saying that through His word He has given us exceedingly great and precious promises. And through these promises in the word, we can partake of His divine nature.\r
 \r
However, though you have a divine nature, which is the life of Christ in you, you can't partake of it until you begin to function in the promises. Come up to the higher ground today and function in the word.\r

"Be Careful What You Think","Every Prayer","""2016-06-08T10:18:56.444Z""","""2016-06-08T00:00:00.000Z""","\r
But his delight and desire are in the law of the Lord, and on His law (the precepts, the instructions, the teachings of God) he habitually meditates (ponders and studies) by day and by night. And he shall be like a tree firmly planted [and tended] by the streams of water, ready to bring forth its fruit in its season; its leaf also shall not fade or wither, and everything he does shall prosper I and come to maturity].Psalm 1:2-3\r
Your word has I laid up in my heart, that I might not sin against You...I will meditate on Your precepts and have respect to Your ways [the paths of life marked out by Your law]. Psalm 119:11, 15\r
In the early days of computers, they used to say, ""Garbage in, garbage out."" That was a way of explaining that the computer only worked with the data put into the machine. If we wanted different results, we needed to put in different information.\r
When it comes to computers, most people have no trouble grasping that concept, but when it comes to their minds, they don't seem to get it. Or perhaps they don't want to get it. So many things demand their attention and beg for their focus. They're not just sinful things. The apostle Paul said that although everything was lawful for him, not everything was helpful (see l Corinthians 6:12).\r
If you are going to win the battle of the mind and defeat your enemy, where you focus your attention is crucial. The more you meditate on God's Word, the stronger you'll become and the more easily you'll win the victories.\r
Too many Christians don't realise the difference between meditating on the Bible and reading the Bible. They like to think that whenever they read God's Word, they're absorbing the deep things of God. Too often people will read a chapter of the Bible, and when they get to the last verse, they have little idea of what they've read. Those who meditate on Gods Word are those who think and think seriously about what they're reading.\r
They may not put it in these words, but they are saying, ""God, speak to me. Teach me. As I ponder Your Word, reveal its depth to me.""\r
In today’s scripture, I quoted from Psalm 1. This psalm begins by defining the person who is blessed and then points out the right actions of that person. The psalmist wrote that those who meditate and do it day and night are like productive trees...and everything they do shall prosper.\r
The psalmist made it quite clear that meditating on and thinking about God's Word brings results. As you ponder who God is and what He’s saying to you, you'll grow. It's really that simple. Another way to put it is to say that whatever you focus on, you become. If you read about and allow your mind to focus on God's love and power, that's what operates in you.\r
The apostle Paul says it beautifully in Philippians 4:8: ...""Whatever is true, whatever is worthy of reverence and is honorable and seemly, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely and lovable, whatever is kind and winsome and gracious, if there are any virtue and excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think on and weigh and take account of these things [fix your minds on them].""\r
It's sad, but most Christians don't put much effort into their study of the Word_ They go to hear others teach and preach, and they may listen to sermon tapes and read the Bible occasionally, but they're not dedicated to making God's Word a major part of their lives.\r
Be careful what you think about. The more you think about good things, the better your life will seem. The more you think about Jesus Christ and the principles He taught, the more you become like Jesus and the stronger you grow And as you grow, you win the battle for your mind.\r
Lord God, help me think about the things that honour` You. Fill my life with a hunger for more of You and Your Word so that in everything I may prosper. I ask this through Jesus Christ. Amen.\r

"Then What’s Next To Do?","Myutmost for his highest","""2016-06-08T10:21:04.712Z""","""2016-06-09T00:00:00.000Z""","Everyone who asks receives… —Luke 11:10\r
\r
Ask if you have not received. There is nothing more difficult than asking. We will have yearnings and desires for certain things, and even suffer as a result of their going unfulfilled, but not until we are at the limit of desperation will we ask. It is the sense of not being spiritually real that causes us to ask. Have you ever asked out of the depths of your total insufficiency and poverty? “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God…” (James 1:5), but be sure that you do lack wisdom before you ask. You cannot bring yourself to the point of spiritual reality anytime you choose. The best thing to do, once you realise you are not spiritually real, is to ask God for the Holy Spirit, basing your request on the promise of Jesus Christ (see Luke 11:13). The Holy Spirit is the one who makes everything that Jesus did for you real in your life.\r
“Everyone who asks receives….” This does not mean that you will not get if you do not ask, but it means that until you come to the point of asking, you will not receive from God (seeMatthew 5:45). To be able to receive means that you have to come into the relationship of a child of God, and then you comprehend and appreciate mentally, morally, and with spiritual understanding, that these things come from God.\r
“If any of you lacks wisdom….” If you realise that you are lacking, it is because you have come in contact with spiritual reality— do not put the blinders of reason on again. The word asks actually means “beg.” Some people are poor enough to be interested in their poverty, and some of us are poor enough spiritually to show our interest. Yet we will never receive if we ask with a certain result in mind because we are asking out of our lust, not out of our poverty. A pauper does not ask out of any reason other than the completely hopeless and painful condition of his poverty. He is not ashamed to beg— blessed are the paupers in spirit (see Matthew 5:3).\r

"Put the rumor to rest","Faith for Faith","""2016-06-08T10:33:34.560Z""","""2016-06-07T00:00:00.000Z""","Years ago Satan started a rumor. He told a few Christians they had to live like the world, sharing all the same misfortune, defeat, poverty and failure as those around them. Well, the word spread. You may have heard the rumor yourself. But I am telling you right now that it is a crafty lie.\r
The Word of God says in Psalm 91:10, that evil can’t even come near your house if you are abiding in Him.\r
In John 16, Jesus Himself says He has deprived the world of power to harm you. And Exodus 10:23 says that when thick darkness surrounded the Egyptians, the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\r
By these and other scriptures, you can see that God never intended you to experience all of the junk that the world suffers. He’s always wanted His children to live above it, to stand out as light in a dark world.\r
In the Old Testament, God’s fame was established because of the miracles He had worked for His children. That same thing should be true today with you and me. We should be glorifying God by the miraculously victorious lives we live. People should be coming up to us and saying things like, “I’ve heard how God healed you.” Or, “I’ve heard how your children were delivered from drugs,” or, “God has really brought you out of a financial crisis.”\r
Can you see now why Satan would spread a rumor that would make you believe you have to suffer with the world instead of live as victor over it? He doesn’t want people running after you asking where you get your power, your peace, your health and prosperity.\r
But that’s exactly what God wants to happen. So, put the Word of God to work and dare to receive the blessings He has promised to you. Let the light of God’s power in your life put the devil’s dark rumors to rest!\r

\r
Seek if you have not found. “You ask and do not receive because you ask amiss…” (James 4:3). If you ask for things from life instead of from God, “you ask amiss”; that is, you ask out of your desire for self-fulfillment. The more you fulfil yourself the less you will seek God. “…seek, and you will find….” Get to work— narrow your focus and interests to this one thing. Have you ever sought God with your whole heart, or have you simply given Him a feeble cry after some emotionally painful experience? “…seek, [focus,] and you will find….”\r
“Ho! Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters…” (Isaiah 55:1). Are you thirsty, or complacent and indifferent— so satisfied with your own experience that you want nothing more of God? Experience is a doorway, not a final goal. Beware of building your faith on experience, or your life will not ring true and will only sound the note of a critical spirit. Remember that you can never give another person what you have found, but you can cause him to have a desire for it.\r
“…knock, and it will be opened to you” (Luke 11:9). “Draw near to God…” (James 4:8). Knock— the door is closed, and your heartbeat races as you knock. “Cleanse your hands…” (James 4:8). Knock a bit louder— you begin to find that you are dirty. “…purify your hearts…” (James 4:8). It is becoming even more personal— you are desperate and serious now— you will do anything. “Lament…” (James 4:9). Have you ever lamented, expressing your sorrow before God for the condition of your inner life? There is no thread of self-pity left, only the heart-rending difficulty and amazement which comes from seeing what kind of person you really are. “Humble yourselves…” (James 4:10). It is a humbling experience to knock at God’s door— you have to knock with the crucified thief. “…to him who knocks it will be opened” (Luke 11:10).\r

That may sound odd to you, especially if you don’t have much of an interest in the Word right now. But, believe me, it’s possible. I’ve done it myself and I’ve seen others do it, time and again.\r
All you have to do is make a decision to give yourself to it. To focus your time and attention on it. The more you give yourself to it, the more your desire for it will grow. Eventually, it will consume your thinking.\r
Surprised? You shouldn’t be. That happens with anything you totally give yourself to. It happens, for example, with people who give themselves to pornography. As they focus their attention on it, the spirit behind it moves in on their consciousness and eventually draws them from mental activity into physical activity. Finally, they come to a place where they can’t be satisfied. They can’t get enough.\r
That same principle works on the positive side when you begin to give yourself to God’s Word. You can give yourself to it to the point where it totally consumes your mental and physical life. The more of it you get, the more you want. The Spirit behind the Word, the Holy Spirit, will draw you and lead you closer to Jesus than you ever imagined possible.\r
I’ve never yet met anyone walking in faith and power who at some time hadn’t developed that kind of addiction by giving themselves totally to the Word for an extended time. I don’t mean just a few minutes here and there either. I’m talking about some serious time.\r
So determine to do that. Determine to become a “Word addict.” Once you do, you’ll never be willing to live without it again.\r

" Averting Judgment"," daily manna","""2016-06-08T10:42:30.878Z""","""2016-06-08T00:00:00.000Z""","Through nine rhetorical questions in our text, Prophet Amos pronounces God's revelation of the judgment on the sin of Israel. Warnings are wrapped in the posers, which are themselves very profound truths designed to teach deep Kingdom and relational realities. Can two walk together if they are not spiritually compatible? Would a Holy God entertain companionship with carnal man? No. The carnal man must first abandon his sinful way. If the Lion of the tribe of Judah should roar against sin, would the sinner not tremble and fear? And if the battle trumpet be blown, would there not be a flight for safety? Notwithstanding, there is God's assurance that even in anger He is merciful. What God is telling us is that He will always use His servants to issue warnings before moving in with judgments if the need arises. Can man then murmur when swift divine judgment follows the refusal to repent? We are the architect of the evil that accompanies sin, not God. The instructive takeaway of the lesson today is that the sinner and backslider as well as the careless Christian should not handle God's warning about the wrath to come with levity. God's admonitions are the Father's unique way of showing mercy to us. It is also a clarion call to the believer not to fall for the erroneous teaching of eternal security which assumes that a saved person can live a care-free life without watching against the possibility of backsliding. God's precepts are for all and sundry. Proverb 14:16 says it all: ""A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.""\r

It is perhaps the most destructive and the most widely accepted misinterpretation of Scripture that exists in the Body of Christ today. I’ve gone into countries to preach to people who hardly had any knowledge of the Word at all and still I have found that somehow they’d been taught about Paul’s thorn.\r
And most of them have been taught wrongly.\r
Tradition says that God gave Paul the thorn in the flesh. What’s more, tradition makes the “thorn” into some great mystery. But the Scripture doesn’t say that at all!\r
It says that the thorn in the flesh was a messenger of Satan. Not God—Satan! The thorn was quite literally just what Paul says it was—a “messenger sent from Satan.”\r
You see, everywhere Paul went, he preached the gospel and every time he preached, he destroyed a little more of Satan’s kingdom. So, Satan sent a messenger, an evil spirit, to stop him.\r
When Paul sought the Lord concerning this thorn (look at 2 Corinthians 12:8-10), God didn’t answer Paul in the negative. God said, “My grace (or, My favor) is enough. It is sufficient for you. For My strength is made perfect in your weakness (inability to produce results)” (W.E. Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words).\r
In other words, when Paul didn’t have enough human strength to overcome, God’s miracle-working power was sufficient for him. It enabled him to be an overcomer in spite of his weakness.\r
Don’t allow the devil to talk you out of your victory. Throw tradition aside and dare to believe the Word of God. Fight the fight of faith, and just like the Apostle Paul, you will see the salvation of the Lord!\r

That brings love out of the indefinite into something explicit. But God has done more than define love for you. He’s given you instructions so that you can know how to love as He loves. By giving you His Word, God has given you His love manual in black and white. All you have to do is follow it and you’ll be walking in love.\r
If you’ve made Jesus Christ the Lord of your life, you’ve already taken the first step of obedience. The love of God has been born within you. But, unless you take steps to develop it, that love will remain hidden within you. Love works in much the same way as the force of faith. Like faith, love becomes active through knowledge of the Word.\r
Become love conscious by confessing and acting on God’s Word today. As you meditate these scriptures, see yourself living the love life. See yourself walking in accordance with and guided by the commandments of Jesus. Develop the love He has hidden in you.\r

Many of us have learned to believe God to prosper us to such a degree that we have too much to keep up with. We end up spending so much time and energy taking care of the legitimate “things” of life that we unconsciously give the attention and affections of our heart over to this natural world instead of to God.\r
When Kenneth and I first heard about living by faith, we were in desperate circumstances. We were sick and broke, so it was easy for us to dedicate ourselves to prayer and to the Word. But as we honored God’s Word, He honored and prospered us. We came to the place where we were no longer desperate. Then came the real test of our faith. Would we serve God out of our love for Him instead of our desperation?\r
Well, praise God, we did. But in the process we found out one thing: It takes a lot more dedication to serve God when you’re prosperous than it takes when you’re desperate! There’s a constant temptation to get so caught up in the earthly things that your desire for the things of God fades into the background.\r
As the material blessings of God come your way, remember, God has not trained you in His Word so you can consume it on your own lusts. He has revealed His Word to you so you can walk in the spirit and do the job He’s called you to do.\r
Don’t let the things of this world cause you to miss out on the glorious things of the spirit. Get your priorities in line with God’s Word. Set your mind on things above, and you’ll discover just how heavenly life was really meant to be!\r

Where sin and sorrow stops, and the song of the saint starts. Do I really want to get there? I can right now. The questions that truly matter in life are remarkably few, and they are all answered by these words— “Come to Me.” Our Lord’s words are not, “Do this, or don’t do that,” but— “Come to me.” If I will simply come to Jesus, my real life will be brought into harmony with my real desires. I will actually cease from sin, and will find the song of the Lord beginning in my life.\r
Have you ever come to Jesus? Look at the stubbornness of your heart. You would rather do anything than this one simple childlike thing— “Come to Me.” If you really want to experience ceasing from sin, you must come to Jesus.\r
Jesus Christ makes Himself the test to determine your genuineness. Look how He used the word come. At the most unexpected moments in your life there is this whisper of the Lord— “Come to Me,” and you are immediately drawn to Him. Personal contact with Jesus changes everything. Be “foolish” enough to come and commit yourself to what He says. The attitude necessary for you to come to Him is one where your will has made the determination to let go of everything and deliberately commit it all to Him.\r
“…and I will give you rest”— that is, “I will sustain you, causing you to stand firm.” He is not saying, “I will put you to bed, hold your hand, and sing you to sleep.” But, in essence, He is saying, “I will get you out of bed— out of your listlessness and exhaustion, and out of your condition of being half dead while you are still alive. I will penetrate you with the spirit of life, and you will be sustained by the perfection of vital activity.” Yet we become so weak and pitiful and talk about “suffering” the will of the Lord!

Any coach will tell you that part of playing the game right is having a winning attitude. That’s what God wants us, as believers, to have. He wants us to have so much faith in Him that we expect to whip any obstacle the devil brings our way. He wants us to expect to win at the game of life.\r
But most of us don’t come by that attitude easily. We’re so accustomed to losing that we have to totally change our way of thinking if we want to have a winning mind-set. In Ephesians, the Apostle Paul told the Church to renew their minds. Like us, they needed to change their attitudes, to renew their minds to the fact that Jesus overcame the world.\r
If you haven’t already, you need to do that too! You need to develop a glorious sense of confidence that says, “Hey, Devil, I’m going to be victorious and there’s not a thing you can do to stop me!”\r

First John 5:5 puts it this way, “Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?”\r

Where our self-interest sleeps and the real interest is awakened. “They…remained with Him that day….” That is about all some of us ever do. We stay with Him a short time, only to wake up to our own realities of life. Our self-interest rises up and our abiding with Him is passed. Yet there is no circumstance of life in which we cannot abide in Jesus.\r
“You are Simon….You shall be called Cephas” (John 1:42). God writes our new name only on those places in our lives where He has erased our pride, self-sufficiency, and self-interest. Some of us have our new name written only in certain spots, like spiritual measles. And in those areas of our lives we look all right. When we are in our best spiritual mood, you would think we were the highest quality saints. But don’t dare look at us when we are not in that mood. A true disciple is one who has his new name written all over him— self-interest, pride, and self-sufficiency has been completely erased.\r
Pride is the sin of making “self” our god. And some of us today do this, not like the Pharisee, but like the tax collector (see Luke 18:9-14). For you to say, “Oh, I’m no saint,” is acceptable by human standards of pride, but it is unconscious blasphemy against God. You defy God to make you a saint, as if to say, “I am too weak and hopeless and outside the reach of the atonement by the Cross of Christ.” Why aren’t you a saint? It is either that you do not want to be a saint, or that you do not believe that God can make you into one. You say it would be all right if God saved you and took you straight to heaven. That is exactly what He will do! And not only do we make our home with Him, but Jesus said of His Father and Himself, “…We will come to him and make Our home with him” (John 14:23).

Where our individual desire dies and sanctified surrender lives. One of the greatest hindrances in coming to Jesus is the excuse of our own individual temperament. We make our temperament and our natural desires barriers to coming to Jesus. Yet the first thing we realise when we do come to Jesus is that He pays no attention whatsoever to our natural desires. We have the idea that we can dedicate our gifts to God. However, you cannot dedicate what is not yours. There is actually only one thing you can dedicate to God, and that is your right to yourself (see Romans 12:1). If you will give God your right to yourself, He will make a holy experiment out of you— and His experiments always succeed. The one true mark of a saint of God is the inner creativity that flows from being totally surrendered to Jesus Christ. In the life of a saint, there is this amazing Well, which is a continual Source of original life. The Spirit of God is a Well of water springing up perpetually fresh. A saint realises that it is God who engineers his circumstances; consequently, there are no complaints, only unrestrained surrender to Jesus. Never try to make your experience a principle for others, but allow God to be as creative and original with others as He is with you.\r
If you abandon everything to Jesus and come when He says, “Come,” then He will continue to say, “Come,” through you. You will go out into the world reproducing the echo of Christ’s “Come.” That is the result in every soul who has abandoned all and come to Jesus.\r

 In the matter of determination. The Spirit of Jesus is put into me by way of the atonement by the Cross of Christ. I then have to build my thinking patiently to bring it into perfect harmony with my Lord. God will not make me think like Jesus— I have to do it myself. I have to bring “every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:5). “Abide in Me”— in intellectual matters, in money matters, in every one of the matters that make human life what it is. Our lives are not made up of only one neatly confined area.\r
Am I preventing God from doing things in my circumstances by saying that it will only serve to hinder my fellowship with Him? How irrelevant and disrespectful that is! It does not matter what my circumstances are. I can be as much assured of abiding in Jesus in any one of them as I am in any prayer meeting. It is unnecessary to change and arrange my circumstances myself. Our Lord’s inner abiding was pure and unblemished. He was at home with God wherever His body was. He never chose His own circumstances, but was meek, submitting to His Father’s plans and directions for Him. Just think of how amazingly relaxed our Lord’s life was! But we tend to keep God at a fever pitch in our lives. We have none of the serenity of the life which is “hidden with Christ in God” (Colossians 3:3).\r
Think of the things that take you out of the position of abiding in Christ. You say, “Yes, Lord, just a minute— I still have this to do. Yes, I will abide as soon as this is finished, or as soon as this week is over. It will be all right, Lord. I will abide then.” Get moving— begin to abide now. In the initial stages it will be a continual effort to abide, but as you continue, it will become so much a part of your life that you will abide in Him without any conscious effort. Make the determination to abide in Jesus wherever you are now or wherever you may be placed in the future.\r

It depends on how many you expect to receive. When God measures them out to you, He’ll be using your measuring stick, not His own. He always works that way.\r
Two people can hear God’s Word about healing, for example. One will measure it with faith. “Praise God, by His stripes I was healed!” he’ll say. “I believe that with all my heart, and I’m going to keep on believing it until I receive my healing.”\r
The other will measure it with skepticism. “I don’t care what Bible verses he comes up with,” he’ll say. “I just don’t trust that preacher. I’ll give this healing stuff a try, but I doubt very much if anything’s going to come of it.”\r
Both of those people will get exactly what they expect. God will measure to them just as they measured the Word. One will get healed...the other won’t.\r
I must warn you though, sometimes measuring the Word with faith is hard. Years ago, when Gloria first read the scripture, “Owe no man anything,” it was tempting for her to measure it as a curse, not a blessing. We were living in a terrible little house at the time, and she wanted a new one more than just about anything.\r
How were we ever going to buy a decent house without borrowing? It didn’t seem possible. So, to her, it was as if that scripture had said, “Gloria, you can’t have a new house.”\r
But she refused to measure it that way. She grabbed the devil by the throat and said, “Look here now, you’re not going to cheat me out of my house.” Then she started believing that somehow God could provide her with a house debt free. Sure enough, He did.\r
If you want to receive blessings by the bushel load, start going to the Word with a bushel basket. Put a big measure of faith in the hand of God. He’ll fill it to overflowing and give it right back to you!\r

When God gives you a vision for your life, it’ll burn within you like a fire that can’t be extinguished. The psalmist said, ‘My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned.’ So, what are you passionate about? What burns ‘hot’ within you? When God calls you to do something, He creates within you both the desire to do it and the power to carry it out. Though you feel inadequate and unqualified, stand on His Word: ‘For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him’ (Philippians 2:13 NLT). Mahatma Gandhi had a vision of a free and independent India at a time when it was governed by the British. Henry Ford had a vision of every family in America owning the automobile at a time when people were frightened of his new invention. Daniel K. Ludwig had a vision of a self-supporting industrial region in the heart of the Brazilian jungle at a time when there was no industry, no electricity, and no city of any kind for hundreds of miles. Where do such creative desires come from? God, Who is our Creator! And when God gives you a true worldview, you’ll never be happy living in a narrow mental framework. Are there times when you’ll feel afraid and uncertain about what to do? Yes! Fear and faith are two sides of the same coin, and they’ll always be part of your thinking.

1 Corinthians 13:8\r
The Bible says, ‘Love never fails.’ Think about it: money doesn’t bring happiness, fame doesn’t bring self-worth, and revenge doesn’t bring satisfaction. The only thing that never fails is love. When Mother Teresa addressed world leaders at the United Nations, she was asked, ‘How can we have world peace?’ She replied, ‘Go home and love your family.’ If we all did that, ‘Paradise Lost’ would become ‘Paradise Found’! Napoleon Bonaparte’s intellectual greatness and intense egotism make his alleged tribute to the supremacy of leadership by love, all the more striking. He said, ‘Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, and I myself founded great empires: but upon what did the creations of our genius depend on ? Upon force. Jesus alone founded His empire upon love, and to this day millions would die for Him.’ Sometimes leaders are just power-holders. Because you can’t love others without making yourself vulnerable, they see expressing love as a weakness. But the fact is you can’t love and ‘keep all your options open’. To truly love - whether it’s your spouse, your children, or the people you lead - you must give yourself unreservedly in such a way that you can be hurt and even rejected. The fundamental principle on which power-holders operate is to protect themselves and everything they have. Whereas the fundamental principle of true leadership is to give of yourself with no holds barred. Love as an intrinsic characteristic of leadership seems outmoded, yet according to Scripture, it’s still the winning strategy. The Bible says, ‘God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind’ (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV). That’s why love is the winning strategy.\r

The love talked about in Scripture isn’t a sentimental emotion that gives you goose bumps. It’s compassion, caring, and concern for the well-being of another. It’s based on commitment, not convenience. It’s an act of your will, not a reflex of your emotions. Jesus asks a question that makes you stop in your tracks. ‘If you love only those who love you, why should you get credit for that? Even sinners love those who love them! And if you do good only to those who do good to you, why should you get credit?’ (vs. 32-33 NLT). Loving is the hardest thing you’ll ever do, and it will require all the grace God can give you. Jesus continues: ‘Love your enemies! Do good to them! Lend to them without expecting to be repaid. Then your reward from heaven will be very great, and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High, for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked. You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate. Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn others, or it will all come back to you. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven. Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full - pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over … The amount you give will determine the amount you get back’ (vv. 35-38 NLT).

Matthew 22:37\r
\r
One day Christ’s critics asked Him, ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ (v. 36 NIV 2011 Edition). His answer is a timely reminder to both leaders and followers; it includes those who sit in the pews and those who stand in the pulpit. ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart … all your soul and all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment’ (vv. 37-38 NIV 2011 Edition). As a leader you must never leave a question in anyone’s mind as to who is God - and who isn’t. Namely, yourself! God said, ‘You shall have no other gods before Me’ (Exodus 20:3 NKJV). And that’s important because you’re never in greater danger than when people begin to praise you. Yes, we must teach people to respect, honour, and reward good leadership, but the Christlike leader discourages adulation and shies away from the limelight. John the Baptist was so successful as a preacher that when he finished speaking, his audience flocked to Jesus. Speaking of it, Christ later said, in essence, ‘John, you did your job well!’ Apparently John agreed, for he said, ‘He must increase, but I must decrease’ (John 3:30 NKJV). Isaiah wrote, ‘In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up’ (Isaiah 6:1 NKJV). The king had to die before Isaiah saw the Lord. Only when a leader becomes impervious to applause and approval and dies to ego, is God glorified in his or her leadership. Indeed, when Christ alone is exalted, the God-called leader smiles and says, ‘Thank You, Lord - that’s how You intended it.’\r

It’s okay to grow up in poverty, as long as poverty doesn’t grow up on you and control your thinking. One celebrity was asked how he felt about growing up in poverty. Amazingly, he confessed that he still suffered anxiety over having enough in the future. So he tended to be overly frugal, viewed his money as somewhat surreal, and wasn’t able to relax and enjoy the blessings that come with success. However, his wife had brought balance to the relationship with the mindset of giving, spend, and save. Who do you believe is responsible for your success, yourself or God? As long as you are, you’ll remain vulnerable to people, circumstances, and economic conditions. But when you know God’s responsible for your success, what you gain you can maintain. So your options are: trust yourself - or God! The psalmist writes: ‘There is no want to those who truly revere and worship Him with godly fear. The young lions lack food and suffer hunger, but they who seek (inquire of and require) the Lord [by right of their need and on the authority of His Word], none of them shall lack any beneficial thing’ (vv. 9-10 AMP Classic Edition).

Why does the Bible compare us to sheep? Because they’re one of the most dependent creatures in the world; they must trust in the shepherd for everything they need. And that’s how God wants you to live: in dependence on Him. When you constantly live in the fear of lack, you’re not trusting God enough. This core fear drives many of our other fears, including the fear of becoming disabled, or the fear of ageing, or the fear of investing, or the fear of retiring poor. In its extreme form, fear of lack can lead to anxiety that requires you to live on antidepressants or other medication. It’s also one of the root causes of greed. You can become so obsessed with insuring yourself against the possibility of not having enough, that you hoard more than you’ll ever need. It can drive you to become a workaholic so that neither you nor your children will ever experience discomfort, inconvenience, and helplessness. And like all fears, it’s based on an erroneous belief about God - in particular, His ability and willingness to take care of you. ‘The Lord is my Shepherd [to feed, guide, and shield me], I shall not lack.’ Stop living as though you don’t believe what God has promised you! A good strategy is to learn the promises, understand the ones that are conditional, meet the conditions, and rest in His love and faithfulness. This doesn’t mean you sit idly by and wait for God to do what He has given you the ability to do. You must do the natural things, and trust Him for the supernatural ones.\r

Here are some scriptural strategies for conquering your fear of lack: 1) Give God the first tenth of your income (see Malachi 3:8-12; Matthew 23:23). Don’t debate whether it’s an Old Testament rule versus a New Testament requirement. Wouldn’t you rather do more than required, then find out later that you fell short of God’s expectations? 2) Live by the 10-10-80 rule. After you give God the first 10 percent of your income, put the second 10 percent into savings and budget yourself to live on the remaining 80 percent. 3) Confront the areas in which your fear of lack is the greatest. Food? Housing? Transportation? Health insurance? Retirement? Now cast down those imaginations and replace them with this promise: ‘God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others’ (2 Corinthians 9:8 NLT). 4) Refuse to rely solely on your credentials, marketable skills, or influential contacts for the assurance of your financial provision. ‘Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us.’ Maximise your personal power, but trust ultimately in God’s power alone. Jesus said, ‘I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full’ (John 10:10 NIV 2011 Edition). That’s not just ‘spiritual’ life, but every aspect of life.

1 Corinthians 13:4-5\r
\r
Here are some pointers to help you solve your relationship difficulties: 1) When it’s about money. How you manage money within a marriage depends on the set of skills you’ve developed and the amount of discipline you’ve exercised. One of you may be a saver and the other a spender. So you have to work together to make joint decisions that affect both of you, and work within the boundaries of your reality together. Consider how much debt you have, how much income, and how much you need to save. Find a way to achieve financial freedom. The Bible says, ‘The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is a servant to the lender’ (Proverbs 22:7 NKJV). 2) When it’s about time. If you’re not spending time together - one of you is missing the other. Ideally, you both want to spend more time together. But if your partner keeps making this complaint, take it as a compliment that he or she still enjoys your company. Schedule designated times together on both your calendars - with no intrusions. There’s no substitute for spending time with your mate. 3) When it’s about jealousy. We’re not talking about a possessive spouse who won’t allow you to glance at the waiter without accusing you of cheating. But generally, when there’s jealousy in a relationship it’s an indication of insecurity. You may need to have a frank discussion about your commitment to each other. Talk about the little habits and mannerisms your spouse interprets as flirtatious. Communicate, and don’t allow the jealousy to grow into bitterness, distrust, or disgust.\r

Some skeptics view the table of nations in Genesis 10 this way. Seventy names are listed along with the nations that proceeded from Noah’s descendants. The biblical narrator does not give any indication, however, that this list is legendary or allegorical. The list includes the names of individuals along with some of their accomplishments, including some of the greatest cities in biblical history.\r
\r
The purpose of the list is to set the stage for the destruction of the Tower of Babel. The overall impression is one of proliferation and growing ambition. In the next chapter this will culminate in an arrogant attempt to supplant God Himself.\r
\r
Instead of multiplying and filling the earth as they had been commanded (see Gen. 9:1, 7), the men of Babel chose to build a monument to themselves in the form of a city with a tower that reached to the heavens (Gen. 11:4). The function of this tower does not appear to have been for the purpose of worshiping God or even astrological deities. Instead, it was part of their project of self-worship. They were more intent on making a name for themselves than they were on glorifying God’s name. God thwarted their plan by destroying their tower, confusing their language, and scattering the people. This judgment was also a blessing, for it halted their rebellion.\r
\r
This curse was reversed on the day of Pentecost—not by restoring everyone to a single language, but by allowing everyone to declare the wonders of God in the langue of “every nation under heaven” (Acts 2:5). Despite mankind’s rebellion, God continues to work out His ultimate purpose for His creation. The whole earth will be filled with His glory."

But we don’t sing about “Father Abraham” because he gave birth to numerous sons. More importantly, he is our father in the faith.\r

Because of his faith, the Lord rewarded him with the gift of righteousness. In this way Abraham became the prototype of all who believe (see Rom. 4:3; Gal. 3:6; James 2:23).\r
\r
Abraham continued to struggle with doubt. His son by Hagar was the result of an attempt to bring about God’s promise through human effort. But in the end, he “was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised” (Rom. 4:20–21). God waited until Abraham and Sarah were too old to have children by any means other than divine intervention to show that the promise came from God.\r
\r
We are Abraham’s children if we believe God’s promise to give us the gift of righteousness through Jesus Christ (Gal. 3:7).\r

In the matter of drudgery. Peter said in this passage that we have become “partakers of the divine nature” and that we should now be “giving all diligence,” concentrating on forming godly habits (2 Peter 1:4-5). We are to “add” to our lives all that character means. No one is born either naturally or supernaturally with character; it must be developed. Nor are we born with habits— we have to form godly habits on the basis of the new life God has placed within us. We are not meant to be seen as God’s perfect, bright-shining examples, but to be seen as the everyday essence of ordinary life exhibiting the miracle of His grace. Drudgery is the test of genuine character. The greatest hindrance to our spiritual life is that we will only look for big things to do. Yet, “Jesus…took a towel and…began to wash the disciples’ feet…” (John 13:3-5).\r
We all have those times when there are no flashes of light and no apparent thrill to life, where we experience nothing but the daily routine with its common everyday tasks. The routine of life is actually God’s way of saving us between our times of great inspiration which come from Him. Don’t always expect God to give you His thrilling moments, but learn to live in those common times of the drudgery of life by the power of God.\r
It is difficult for us to do the “adding” that Peter mentioned here. We say we do not expect God to take us to heaven on flowery beds of ease, and yet we act as if we do! I must realise that my obedience even in the smallest detail of life has all of the omnipotent power of the grace of God behind it. If I will do my duty, not for duty’s sake but because I believe God is engineering my circumstances, then at the very point of my obedience all of the magnificent grace of God is mine through the glorious atonement by the Cross of Christ.\r

"Two sons and one promise","Moody Global Ministries","""2016-06-08T11:56:03.779Z""","""2016-06-09T00:00:00.000Z""","Abraham’s family life seems strange to most modern readers. In part, this strangeness is due to cultural differences and different customs— few of us are nomadic or live in vast, extended family tribes. But in addition, the strangeness of Abraham’s family is that God was using them as a kind of living parable, providing lessons in following God for future generations.\r
\r
Ishmael was the firstborn son of Abraham—but he was not the son God had promised. Perhaps he felt insecure as the son of Sarah’s servant, or he may have discerned that Abraham felt differently toward Isaac than he did toward Ishmael. Ishmael was likely aware that Isaac had a special place in God’s plan. For whatever reason— perhaps even just plain brotherly teasing—he mocked Isaac, and Sarah saw it and demanded that Abraham banish both Ishmael and Hagar from the household.\r
\r
Despite Abraham’s reluctance to cast out his son, God confirmed Sarah’s harsh sentence but also promised Abraham that He would care for Ishmael. God dealt compassionately with Hagar and Ishmael by providing for their needs and making Ishmael into a great nation. But it was Isaac who was the child of promise.\r
\r
In Galatians 4:28–30 Paul reveals the spiritual lesson in these events. The only way to become a child of God is by way of promise, not through human effort. We cannot become God’s children by trying to obey His commands or solve the problem of sin on our own terms. Righteousness only comes to us as a gift through faith. Like Abraham and Sarah, God must do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. Those who try to obtain righteousness by keeping the law are slaves to the law and to sin. The law cannot free us from sin.\r

"A Father's Sacrifice","Moody Global Ministries","""2016-06-08T13:18:27.844Z""","""2016-06-10T00:00:00.000Z"""," Many parents make sacrifices for their children, but Milwaukee father Eulos Rounds Sr. went beyond what most parents have to do. When his son was diagnosed with liver disease, Rounds volunteered to donate 30 percent of his liver. Rounds not only saved his son’s life but also became the first African- American live transplant donor in the state of Wisconsin.\r
\r
Abraham was asked to make a different kind of sacrifice. God asked him literally to sacrifice his son Isaac. The demand must have seemed strange to Abraham. Isaac was the child through whom God had promised to make Abraham a father of many nations. Yet as far as we are told in Scripture, Abraham did not argue with God. The author of Hebrews tells us why: because of faith in God’s trustworthiness, not mindless obedience. Abraham believed that God was able to raise his son from the dead (Heb. 11:19). God never intended that Abraham would go through with the slaughter; instead, He wanted to make a point: “Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son” (Gen. 22:12).\r
\r
Is it possible to love God’s promises more than God Himself? We can be so distracted by the things God provides that we lose sight of God. When this happens, God may ask us to choose. The language God uses to describe Isaac reveals the importance of this test for Abraham. God calls him Abraham’s “only son” in verse 2. This was not technically true; as we have already seen, Abraham had another son by Sarah’s maid Hagar. But this designation underscored the uniqueness of Isaac both in Abraham’s affection and in God’s plan. Isaac was Abraham’s unique son. He was the child of promise."
"Grace and Favoritism","Moody Global Ministries","""2016-06-08T13:20:13.960Z""","""2016-06-11T00:00:00.000Z""","In his book Everybody’s Normal Till You Get to Know Them, John Ortberg writes about the tendency we have to exclude other people. He uses the example of the different ways an airline will treat the people in first class compared\r
to those in coach: “The first-class passengers were served gourmet food on china and crystal by their own flight attendants; those of us in coach ate snacks served in paper bags with plastic wrappers,” Ortberg writes. “The first- class passengers had room to stretch and sleep; those of us in coach were sitting with a proximity usually reserved for engaged couples in the back row of a movie.” Preferential treatment is a common feature of human behavior.\r
\r
What about God? In today’s passage we learn that God’s plan for Jacob differed from His plan for Esau. Both would become the father of a nation, but the younger brother was to have supremacy. This plan violated cultural norms. In Isaac’s day, the right of inheritance was reserved for the firstborn.\r
\r
What is the difference between grace and favoritism? The chief difference is that favoritism is based on some perceived advantage inherent in the one who is treated differently. It may be wealth, social status, or simply the fact that the one who is treated as a favorite is part of the same club. Grace is not bestowed on the basis of personal worth. Jacob did not deserve the primary place in God’s plan. Isaac and Rebekah demonstrated favoritism in their attitude toward their sons, preferring the child who shared their own interests. God does not show favoritism, but neither does He treat everyone the same. We are not all granted the same abilities, resources, or opportunities. God showed grace in His promise to Jacob, who had done nothing to deserve it, because of His own plans for His people."
"Isaac's Backhanded Blessing","Moody Global Ministries","""2016-06-08T13:48:34.649Z""","""2016-06-12T00:00:00.000Z""","A backhanded compliment is often an insult masquerading as a compliment. In today’s passage we have an example of a backhanded blessing. Isaac blessed Esau as requested—but not with the blessing that Esau wanted. The blessing came after Isaac had given Jacob the blessing originally intended for Esau, the firstborn. At the instigation of his mother, Jacob had disguised himself as his brother in order to steal the blessing that God had already promised to him, taking advantage of his father’s failing eyesight.\r
\r
Isaac discovered the deceit when Esau came to him for the blessing he had already unwittingly bestowed on Jacob. Jacob’s behavior was deceitful, but Esau’s complaint about him was not entirely honest, either. Jacob did not take the birthright; Esau had carelessly sold it to him for a single meal (Gen. 25:29–34). Esau despised his birthright and showed contempt for God (Gen. 25:34; Heb. 12:16–17).\r
\r
We can see the destructive power of parental favoritism at work in this story, but amazingly we also see God working in the midst of this dysfunctional family to accomplish His plan. He is not yet finished working with Jacob, the deceitful schemer. And despite Esau’s godless attitude, he did receive a genuine blessing. Isaac’s backhanded blessing concludes with the promise that Esau’s descendants would eventually throw off the yoke of subjugation.\r
\r
Old Testament commentator Derek Kidner describes Esau’s blessing as “the appropriate destiny of the ‘profane person’: the freedom to live unblessed and untamed.” John Calvin similarly noted that the “unbridled liberty of Esau was more wretched than any state of subjection.” For some who have scorned His promises and priorities, God’s worst judgment may be to grant us our heart’s desire."
"The trickster meets his match","Moody Global Ministries","""2016-06-08T13:50:35.432Z""","""2016-06-13T00:00:00.000Z""","In mythology, legend, and story, the trickster is a character who survives through lying or deceit. Tricksters often violate cultural norms and subvert those who are in power. Every culture has stories in which the trickster is a key player. Some scholars have seen elements of the trickster in Jacob. He was a man who survived by cunning and deceit. But in today’s text Jacob the Trickster meets his match—both in love and war.\r
\r
Today’s passage is a love story, describing how Jacob fell in love with Rachel but was tricked into marrying Leah by their father, Laban. Why would a father do such a thing to his daughter? Laban’s explanation was that it was not customary for the younger daughter to marry first. This was probably true, but Laban also had another motive. By deceiving the deceiver, Laban tricked Jacob into giving him fourteen years of service instead of seven.\r
\r
Family drama fills this account. Laban uses his own daughters to barter for Jacob’s services. Rachel is loved more than Leah. Yet once again we will see that God is working out His purposes in the midst of what most of us would call serious family dysfunction.\r
\r
As for Jacob, this turn of events was part of God’s long process of taming the trickster and turning him into a man of faith. Jacob’s trials were far from over. But by turning the tables on him, God had begun to wean Jacob away from a lifestyle of self-reliance. In time Jacob would learn that God’s promise comes by faith and not by human effort, schemes, or trickery. \r
\r
Jacob did not learn this lesson easily and neither do we. The overall nature of his life was one of struggle—with his brother, then with his father-in-law, and eventually with God Himself (see Gen. 32:28).\r

But in October 2015, China abandoned its policy of limiting families to one child. The one- child rule was implemented in the late 1970s in an effort to limit population growth. Parents who had a second child were fined and could even lose their jobs. The Chinese government made the recent change in the hope that it would help with China’s rapidly aging population and improve the gender balance.\r
\r
The battle between Jacob’s two wives reveals the opposite cultural value: a woman’s worth was based on her ability to have children. The inability to bear children was considered a mark of shame. In Jacob’s family, this shame was even more acute, and the tension between Rachel and Leah further aggravated by Jacob’s preference for Rachel. This resulted in what might be called “the battle of the babies.”\r
\r
Rachel and Leah vied with one another and even schemed to see who would have the most children. Some of their plots seem reminiscent of Abraham and Sarah’s attempt to force God’s hand through human effort. God had promised to use Jacob’s family line to fulfill the promise made to Abraham that he would be the father of nations. Both Leah and Rachel wanted to be the mother God used to keep that promise.\r
\r
God granted children to both, but not because of their schemes. His actions were motivated by compassion for the two women and in response to their prayers (Gen. 29:31; 30:6). Meanwhile Jacob seems like a hapless tool in all of this. He is passed back and forth between these women and their servants. His only comment is\r
an exasperated admission that the outcome rests in the hands of God (Gen. 30:2).\r

It is the Church that acts as the medium through which the miracles of God manifests to the world. Every individual in the Church of Jesus Christ has distinct functions. Many Christians today do not seem to be aware of the tremendous power they are endowed with once they become born again. Meanwhile, those who acknowledge, appreciate and use accordingly, the power given to them, experience miracles. Miracles from God cause the Church to grow. When there are genuine miracles, there is always an explosion of attendance, spiritual growth and commitment to the work of God. During one of our Holy Ghost services in Nigeria, the power of God was present and several miracles were happening around the altar. As a result, many people were standing up to catch a glimpse of what was responsible for the widespread excitement. There was a man in the congregation who was very short and could not see what was happening because others were taller and were blocking his view. Then with a strong desire, he whispered “Oh Lord, I wish I were taller”, and the Almighty God, who knows the voice of everyone, made him two inches taller. Ordinarily, this is not possible, but where God is involved, impossibilities became possible. This year, whatever looks impossible before you will receive the attention of Heaven in Jesus’ name.\r

You cannot achieve your goals in life if you are not optimistic. When you are positive about the outcome of every situation, what the devil meant for evil will always turn out good for you.

“Saying, what shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.”\r

"Departing from the Lord"," morning star","""2016-06-09T08:29:18.041Z""","""2016-06-09T00:00:00.000Z""","And Cain said to the LORD, ""My punishment is too great to bear!\r
\r
""Behold, Thou hast driven me this day from the face of the ground; and from Thy face I shall be hidden, and I shall be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth, and it will come about that whoever finds me will kill me."" \r
\r
So the LORD said to him, ""Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold."" And the LORD appointed a sign for Cain, lest anyone finding him should slay him. \r
\r
Then Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden (Genesis 4:13-16).\r
\r
When the Lord told Cain how he could be delivered from depression he did not listen. When we do not heed the Lord, it will usually result in our falling even further into sin, just as it did with Cain. Cain still could have turned to the Lord, humbled himself, and repented, and he would have received help. The Lord warned him that he had to master the sin, but he continued down the path of letting his sin master him.\r
\r
It is interesting that, even then, Cain understood the law of sowing and reaping, which Paul explained in Galatians 6:7: ""Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap."" He knew that because he had murdered his brother, he was in danger of being murdered himself. This is a law that is as sure as the law of gravity. Therefore, if we want to receive grace, we should learn to sow grace every chance that we get. If we want to receive mercy, we should learn to sow mercy every chance we get. If we do good, we will reap good. If we do evil, we will reap the same.\r
\r
When reading about Cain's fear of being murdered, one might think, ""Who is going to murder him?"" Adam and Eve lived nearly one thousand years. They did begin to fulfil their commission to multiply and fill the earth, having many other sons and daughters. Obviously, there was already a population on the earth by the time Cain slew Abel. They were obviously close relatives to Cain, but he was still afraid of them. He had slain his own brother, so he knew that a brother could slay him. This was accurate enough, because all men ultimately derive their name from the same family, but that has never kept them from attacking one another.\r
\r
Even so, the Lord had mercy on Cain. He gave him a mark that would serve to protect him. Throughout the history of God's dealings with mankind, He has been quick to show unmerited grace and mercy to us. His grace and mercy is even enough for Him to negate the law of sowing and reaping. Throughout the Scriptures, we have many examples of the Lord causing crop failures from the evil seeds men have sown. However, we also have examples of swift judgement for those who have hardened their hearts and presumed upon His grace and mercy.\r
\r
The worst result of Cain's sin of murdering his brother was that he ""went out from the presence of the Lord."" When fighting occurs between brethren in churches, or between churches, this is often the ultimate result. Many will end up actually departing from the Lord. That is why from the very beginning, one of the enemy's primary strategies has been to get brothers to fight with each other. He is called ""the accuser of our brethren"" (see Revelation 12:10), because one of his most effective weapons against us is to get us accusing one another.\r
\r
Cain somehow thought that Abel was the reason for his rejection. The rejection of Cain's offering had nothing to do with Abel's offering. The answer to Cain's problem had nothing to do with Abel, but with himself. However, from the beginning, blaming someone else for our own problems has been one of the primary deceptions that has kept men from the grace of God. It has also led to the most destructive wars in history, and it has led to the most destructive wars between churches in history.\r
\r
First, the enemy will try to get us to be jealous of others. Then he will get us to accuse them of being the reason for our own problems. That is why nations that are having serious difficulties become so dangerous. It often seems much easier to blame someone else and attack them instead of dealing with our own problems. People will tend to rally around us if we can portray a common enemy that is causing our problems. Churches and people can become dangerous when they start having serious problems. If you see them starting to attack and blame others, it is time to depart. We must not continue to get caught in this trap of the enemy, which is the seemingly cheap escape from dealing with our own shortcomings. It will lead us to needlessly wounding others. Even worse than that, it will also lead us to ""departing from the presence of the Lord."

While some are looking up to God for healing, others are looking for deliverance from satanic afflictions, and some are struggling from self and sin. The Name of Jesus is a universal cure for all problems. If you believe in Jesus, no matter how hopeless your situation and condition maybe, there will be a supernatural intervention in your life.\r
\r
Every believer carries a measure of God’s glory. However, as we walk with God, we realise that the glory of God is in different phases, and God expects us to move from one level of glory to another consistently. In Christ, there is only a starting point but there is no end to the activation of His glory and wonders in our lives. All we need to do is believe Him and follow as He leads. Prayer precedes penetration into certain realms of God’s glory. Performing wonders is easy when the glory of God saturates our lives."

\r
Aren't you thankful for God's abundant mercy? it is new every morning. Surely we would all live miserable, defeated lives if it were not for His compassion and willingness to forgive us. \r
\r
When we meditate on God's mercy and truly realise how much He willingly forgives us, we can much more easily show mercy to others. Good relationships are impossible unless we are generous with mercy and forgiveness. Being merciful simply means forgiving others even though their actions would warrant our anger. \r
\r
Jesus said that we are to forgive our enemies and be kind. In this way, we show ourselves to be like our Father in heaven, for He is merciful and kind. \r
\r
God's mercy is new every morning, and I am glad—because I am sure I use my allotted portion every day. I am grateful for a new, fresh start each day. When we make mistakes, He does not want us to try to sacrifice to make up for them. When others hurt or offend us, He wants us to extend mercy to them. \r

Learn to give and receive mercy regularly, and let mercy become a way of life for you. \r

When God gives you a vision for your life, it’ll burn within you like a fire that can’t be extinguished. The psalmist said, ‘My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned.’ So, what lights your fire? What burns ‘hot’ within you? When God calls you to do something, He creates within you both the desire to do it and the power to carry it out. Though you feel inadequate and unqualified, stand on His Word: ‘For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases Him.’ (Philippians 2:13 NLT) Mahatma Gandhi had a vision of a free and independent India at a time when it was governed by the British. Henry Ford had a vision of every family in America owning an automobile at a time when people were frightened of his new invention. Daniel K. Ludwig had a vision of a self-supporting industrial region in the heart of the Brazilian jungle at a time when there was no industry, no electricity, and no city of any kind for hundreds of kilometres. Where do such creative desires come from? God, Who is our Creator! And when God gives you a wide-blue-sky mindset, you’ll never be happy living in a mental birdcage. Are there times when you’ll feel afraid and uncertain about what to do? Yes! Fear and faith are two sides of the same coin, and they’ll always be part of your thinking. But the one you choose is the one that’ll determine your future—and you get to choose!\r

Perhaps you’re wondering, ‘What am I supposed to do with my life? What’s my purpose here?’ God answers these questions through our abilities. He leads us to our life’s purpose through the skills and talents He has given us. God-given gifts are the skills a person easily performs, often without formal training. We derive great pleasure from doing what we’re naturally good at doing. So if you aren’t sure of your life’s purpose, just do what you do well and watch God confirm it by blessing your endeavours. Don’t spend your time trying to do what you’re not gifted to do, or what somebody else is good at. We know we’re operating in our gifts and calling when what we do ministers life to others. If what we do makes us miserable and fills us with a sense of dread, usually we’re not in God’s perfect will. He gives us peace and joy to let us know we’re fulfilling His perfect plan: ‘For you shall go out with joy, and be led out with peace.’ Look at what you enjoy, what you’re good at, and what God is giving you the grace to do—then let God be God in your life. He wants to flow through you, and it may not be in the same way as He flows through others. Trust His ability in and through you, and don’t be afraid to be unique.

The Bible says, ‘Love never fails.’ Think about it: money doesn’t bring happiness, fame doesn’t bring self-worth, and revenge doesn’t bring satisfaction. The only thing that never fails is love. When Mother Teresa addressed world leaders at the United Nations, she was asked, ‘How can we have world peace?’ She replied, ‘Go home and love your family.’ If we all did that, ‘Paradise Lost’ would become ‘Paradise Found’! Napoleon Bonaparte’s intellectual greatness and intense egotism make his alleged tribute to the supremacy of leadership by love all the more striking. He said, ‘Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne and I myself founded great empires: but upon what did the creations of our genius depend? Upon force. Jesus alone founded His empire upon love, and to this day millions would die for Him.’ Sometimes leaders are just power-holders. Because you can’t love others without making yourself vulnerable, they see expressing love as a weakness. But the fact is you can’t love and ‘keep all your options open’. To truly love—whether it’s your spouse, your children, or the people you lead—you must give yourself unreservedly in such a way that you can be hurt and even rejected. The fundamental principle on which power-holders operate is to protect themselves and everything they have. Whereas the fundamental principle of true leadership is to give of yourself with no holds barred. Love as an intrinsic characteristic of leadership seems outmoded, yet according to Scripture it’s still the winning strategy. The Bible says, ‘God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.’ (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV) That’s why love is the winning strategy.\r

 \r
You are royalty. You have been made kings and priests unto God. The reason the devil runs roughshod over you is because you have refused to understand this fact and to behave like royalty. There are environments in which you can't find a worldly prince because he is royalty. There are ways in which he can't talk. There are movies he can't watch because he does not want his mind to be twisted. There is music he does not listen to. There are books he will not read. He lives his life by virtue of who he is. He lives his life conscious of the fact that he is royalty. Because he is born royalty, others will train him and guide him to live the life of royalty. He is uncommon, so he can't function like a common man.\r
 \r
The word 'common' means ordinary, inferior, lacking distinction, mean, low, lacking in rank, and not exceptional. Why would you function like a common man when God has elevated you? Ephesians 2:4-6 (KJV) says, ""But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) And hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus"".\r
 \r
For too long the church has been a misrepresentation of royalty. That is why it appears as if we don't have the authority to declare things and have them carried out. Because the devil says, ""What do you mean, you are like me? What right do you have to tell me what to do? There is no difference between us. You live like me."" Child of God, you are royalty! So stop living life frivolously. Take responsibility for your life. You are the extension of God in your world. You are His righteousness. You are His beloved. Square up your shoulders, knowing who you are. It's your assignment. Understand that you are royalty and live like royalty.\r

\r
 Am I fulfilling this ministry of intercession deep within the hidden recesses of my life? There is no trap nor any danger at all of being deceived or of showing pride in true intercession. It is a hidden ministry that brings forth fruit through which the Father is glorified. Am I allowing my spiritual life to waste away, or am I focused, bringing everything to one central point— the atonement of my Lord? Is Jesus Christ more and more dominating every interest of my life? If the central point, or the most powerful influence, of my life, is the atonement of the Lord, then every aspect of my life will bear fruit for Him.\r
However, I must take the time to realise what this central point of power is. Am I willing to give one minute out of every hour to concentrate on it? “If you abide in Me…”— that is if you continue to act, and think, and work from that central point— “you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you” (John 15:7). Am I abiding? Am I taking the time to abide? What is the greatest source of power in my life? Is it my work, service, and sacrifice for others, or is it my striving to work for God? It should be none of these— what ought to exert the greatest power in my life is the atonement of the Lord. It is not on what we spend the greatest amount of time that moulds us the most, but whatever exerts the most power over us. We must make a determination to limit and concentrate our desires and interests on the atonement by the Cross of Christ.\r
“Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do….” The disciple who abides in Jesus is the will of God, and what appears to be his free choices are actually God’s foreordained decrees. Is this mysterious? Does it appear to contradict sound logic or seem totally absurd? Yes, but what a glorious truth it is a saint of God.\r

But the problem is that spiritual men and women want to live their lives in the flesh. ""For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace"" (Romans 8:6, KJV). To be carnally minded means that you are thinking like the rest of the world even though you are a spiritual person. As long as you want to dominate the material world in your flesh, you will never succeed, because there is a devil that is loosed on earth to hinder you. But God is saying that through His word He has given us exceedingly great and precious promises. And through these promises in the word, we can partake of His divine nature.\r

However, though you have a divine nature, which is the life of Christ in you, you can't partake of it until you begin to function in the promises. Come up to the higher ground today and function in the word.\r

In the early days of computers, they used to say, ""Garbage in, garbage out."" That was a way of explaining that the computer only worked with the data put into the machine. If we wanted different results, we needed to put in different information.\r
When it comes to computers, most people have no trouble grasping that concept, but when it comes to their minds, they don't seem to get it. Or perhaps they don't want to get it. So many things demand their attention and beg for their focus. They're not just sinful things. The apostle Paul said that although everything was lawful for him, not everything was helpful (see l Corinthians 6:12).\r
If you are going to win the battle of the mind and defeat your enemy, where you focus your attention is crucial. The more you meditate on God's Word, the stronger you'll become and the more easily you'll win the victories.\r
Too many Christians don't realise the difference between meditating on the Bible and reading the Bible. They like to think that whenever they read God's Word, they're absorbing the deep things of God. Too often people will read a chapter of the Bible, and when they get to the last verse, they have little idea of what they've read. Those who meditate on Gods Word are those who think and think seriously about what they're reading.\r
They may not put it in these words, but they are saying, ""God, speak to me. Teach me. As I ponder Your Word, reveal its depth to me.""\r
In today’s scripture, I quoted from Psalm 1. This psalm begins by defining the person who is blessed and then points out the right actions of that person. The psalmist wrote that those who meditate and do it day and night are like productive trees...and everything they do shall prosper.\r
The psalmist made it quite clear that meditating on and thinking about God's Word brings results. As you ponder who God is and what He’s saying to you, you'll grow. It's really that simple. Another way to put it is to say that whatever you focus on, you become. If you read about and allow your mind to focus on God's love and power, that's what operates in you.\r
The apostle Paul says it beautifully in Philippians 4:8: ...""Whatever is true, whatever is worthy of reverence and is honorable and seemly, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely and lovable, whatever is kind and winsome and gracious, if there are any virtue and excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think on and weigh and take account of these things [fix your minds on them].""\r
It's sad, but most Christians don't put much effort into their study of the Word_ They go to hear others teach and preach, and they may listen to sermon tapes and read the Bible occasionally, but they're not dedicated to making God's Word a major part of their lives.\r
Be careful what you think about. The more you think about good things, the better your life will seem. The more you think about Jesus Christ and the principles He taught, the more you become like Jesus and the stronger you grow And as you grow, you win the battle for your mind.\r
Lord God, help me think about the things that honour` You. Fill my life with a hunger for more of You and Your Word so that in everything I may prosper. I ask this through Jesus Christ. Amen.\r"

\r
Ask if you have not received. There is nothing more difficult than asking. We will have yearnings and desires for certain things, and even suffer as a result of their going unfulfilled, but not until we are at the limit of desperation will we ask. It is the sense of not being spiritually real that causes us to ask. Have you ever asked out of the depths of your total insufficiency and poverty? “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God…” (James 1:5), but be sure that you do lack wisdom before you ask. You cannot bring yourself to the point of spiritual reality anytime you choose. The best thing to do, once you realise you are not spiritually real, is to ask God for the Holy Spirit, basing your request on the promise of Jesus Christ (see Luke 11:13). The Holy Spirit is the one who makes everything that Jesus did for you real in your life.\r
“Everyone who asks receives….” This does not mean that you will not get if you do not ask, but it means that until you come to the point of asking, you will not receive from God (seeMatthew 5:45). To be able to receive means that you have to come into the relationship of a child of God, and then you comprehend and appreciate mentally, morally, and with spiritual understanding, that these things come from God.\r
“If any of you lacks wisdom….” If you realise that you are lacking, it is because you have come in contact with spiritual reality— do not put the blinders of reason on again. The word asks actually means “beg.” Some people are poor enough to be interested in their poverty, and some of us are poor enough spiritually to show our interest. Yet we will never receive if we ask with a certain result in mind because we are asking out of our lust, not out of our poverty. A pauper does not ask out of any reason other than the completely hopeless and painful condition of his poverty. He is not ashamed to beg— blessed are the paupers in spirit (see Matthew 5:3).\r

The Word of God says in Psalm 91:10, that evil can’t even come near your house if you are abiding in Him.\r
In John 16, Jesus Himself says He has deprived the world of power to harm you. And Exodus 10:23 says that when thick darkness surrounded the Egyptians, the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\r
By these and other scriptures, you can see that God never intended you to experience all of the junk that the world suffers. He’s always wanted His children to live above it, to stand out as light in a dark world.\r
In the Old Testament, God’s fame was established because of the miracles He had worked for His children. That same thing should be true today with you and me. We should be glorifying God by the miraculously victorious lives we live. People should be coming up to us and saying things like, “I’ve heard how God healed you.” Or, “I’ve heard how your children were delivered from drugs,” or, “God has really brought you out of a financial crisis.”\r
Can you see now why Satan would spread a rumor that would make you believe you have to suffer with the world instead of live as victor over it? He doesn’t want people running after you asking where you get your power, your peace, your health and prosperity.\r

Seek if you have not found. “You ask and do not receive because you ask amiss…” (James 4:3). If you ask for things from life instead of from God, “you ask amiss”; that is, you ask out of your desire for self-fulfillment. The more you fulfil yourself the less you will seek God. “…seek, and you will find….” Get to work— narrow your focus and interests to this one thing. Have you ever sought God with your whole heart, or have you simply given Him a feeble cry after some emotionally painful experience? “…seek, [focus,] and you will find….”\r
“Ho! Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters…” (Isaiah 55:1). Are you thirsty, or complacent and indifferent— so satisfied with your own experience that you want nothing more of God? Experience is a doorway, not a final goal. Beware of building your faith on experience, or your life will not ring true and will only sound the note of a critical spirit. Remember that you can never give another person what you have found, but you can cause him to have a desire for it.\r
“…knock, and it will be opened to you” (Luke 11:9). “Draw near to God…” (James 4:8). Knock— the door is closed, and your heartbeat races as you knock. “Cleanse your hands…” (James 4:8). Knock a bit louder— you begin to find that you are dirty. “…purify your hearts…” (James 4:8). It is becoming even more personal— you are desperate and serious now— you will do anything. “Lament…” (James 4:9). Have you ever lamented, expressing your sorrow before God for the condition of your inner life? There is no thread of self-pity left, only the heart-rending difficulty and amazement which comes from seeing what kind of person you really are. “Humble yourselves…” (James 4:10).

All you have to do is make a decision to give yourself to it. To focus your time and attention on it. The more you give yourself to it, the more your desire for it will grow. Eventually, it will consume your thinking.\r
Surprised? You shouldn’t be. That happens with anything you totally give yourself to. It happens, for example, with people who give themselves to pornography. As they focus their attention on it, the spirit behind it moves in on their consciousness and eventually draws them from mental activity into physical activity. Finally, they come to a place where they can’t be satisfied. They can’t get enough.\r
That same principle works on the positive side when you begin to give yourself to God’s Word. You can give yourself to it to the point where it totally consumes your mental and physical life. The more of it you get, the more you want. The Spirit behind the Word, the Holy Spirit, will draw you and lead you closer to Jesus than you ever imagined possible.\r

Warnings are wrapped in the posers, which are themselves very profound truths designed to teach deep Kingdom and relational realities. Can two walk together if they are not spiritually compatible? Would a Holy God entertain companionship with carnal man? No. The carnal man must first abandon his sinful way. If the Lion of the tribe of Judah should roar against sin, would the sinner not tremble and fear? And if the battle trumpet be blown, would there not be a flight for safety? Notwithstanding, there is God's assurance that even in anger He is merciful. What God is telling us is that He will always use His servants to issue warnings before moving in with judgments if the need arises. Can man then murmur when swift divine judgment follows the refusal to repent? We are the architect of the evil that accompanies sin, not God. The instructive takeaway of the lesson today is that the sinner and backslider as well as the careless Christian should not handle God's warning about the wrath to come with levity. God's admonitions are the Father's unique way of showing mercy to us. It is also a clarion call to the believer not to fall for the erroneous teaching of eternal security which assumes that a saved person can live a care-free life without watching against the possibility of backsliding. God's precepts are for all and sundry. Proverb 14:16 says it all: ""A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.""\r

I’ve gone into countries to preach to people who hardly had any knowledge of the Word at all and still I have found that somehow they’d been taught about Paul’s thorn.\r

When Paul sought the Lord concerning this thorn (look at 2 Corinthians 12:8-10), God didn’t answer Paul in the negative. God said, “My grace (or, My favor) is enough. It is sufficient for you. For My strength is made perfect in your weakness (inability to produce results)” (W.E. Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words).\r
In other words, when Paul didn’t have enough human strength to overcome, God’s miracle-working power was sufficient for him. It enabled him to be an overcomer in spite of his weakness.\r
Don’t allow the devil to talk you out of your victory. Throw tradition aside and dare to believe the Word of God. Fight the fight of faith, and just like the Apostle Paul, you will see the salvation of the Lord!\r

That brings love out of the indefinite into something explicit. But God has done more than define love for you. He’s given you instructions so that you can know how to love as He loves. By giving you His Word, God has given you His love manual in black and white. All you have to do is follow it and you’ll be walking in love.\r
If you’ve made Jesus Christ the Lord of your life, you’ve already taken the first step of obedience. The love of God has been born within you. But, unless you take steps to develop it, that love will remain hidden within you. Love works in much the same way as the force of faith. Like faith, love becomes active through knowledge of the Word.\r
Become love conscious by confessing and acting on God’s Word today. As you meditate these scriptures, see yourself living the love life. See yourself walking in accordance with and guided by the commandments of Jesus. Develop the love He has hidden in you.\r

Many of us have learned to believe God to prosper us to such a degree that we have too much to keep up with. We end up spending so much time and energy taking care of the legitimate “things” of life that we unconsciously give the attention and affections of our heart over to this natural world instead of to God.\r
When Kenneth and I first heard about living by faith, we were in desperate circumstances. We were sick and broke, so it was easy for us to dedicate ourselves to prayer and to the Word. But as we honored God’s Word, He honored and prospered us. We came to the place where we were no longer desperate. Then came the real test of our faith. Would we serve God out of our love for Him instead of our desperation?\r
Well, praise God, we did. But in the process we found out one thing: It takes a lot more dedication to serve God when you’re prosperous than it takes when you’re desperate! There’s a constant temptation to get so caught up in the earthly things that your desire for the things of God fades into the background.\r
As the material blessings of God come your way, remember, God has not trained you in His Word so you can consume it on your own lusts. He has revealed His Word to you so you can walk in the spirit and do the job He’s called you to do.\r
Don’t let the things of this world cause you to miss out on the glorious things of the spirit. Get your priorities in line with God’s Word. Set your mind on things above, and you’ll discover just how heavenly life was really meant to be!\r

Where sin and sorrow stops, and the song of the saint starts. Do I really want to get there? I can right now. The questions that truly matter in life are remarkably few, and they are all answered by these words— “Come to Me.” Our Lord’s words are not, “Do this, or don’t do that,” but— “Come to me.” If I will simply come to Jesus, my real life will be brought into harmony with my real desires. I will actually cease from sin, and will find the song of the Lord beginning in my life.\r
Have you ever come to Jesus? Look at the stubbornness of your heart. You would rather do anything than this one simple childlike thing— “Come to Me.” If you really want to experience ceasing from sin, you must come to Jesus.\r
Jesus Christ makes Himself the test to determine your genuineness. Look how He used the word come. At the most unexpected moments in your life there is this whisper of the Lord— “Come to Me,” and you are immediately drawn to Him. Personal contact with Jesus changes everything. Be “foolish” enough to come and commit yourself to what He says. The attitude necessary for you to come to Him is one where your will has made the determination to let go of everything and deliberately commit it all to Him.\r
“…and I will give you rest”— that is, “I will sustain you, causing you to stand firm.” He is not saying, “I will put you to bed, hold your hand, and sing you to sleep.” But, in essence, He is saying, “I will get you out of bed— out of your listlessness and exhaustion, and out of your condition of being half dead while you are still alive. I will penetrate you with the spirit of life, and you will be sustained by the perfection of vital activity.” Yet we become so weak and pitiful and talk about “suffering” the will of the Lord!

Any coach will tell you that part of playing the game right is having a winning attitude. That’s what God wants us, as believers, to have. He wants us to have so much faith in Him that we expect to whip any obstacle the devil brings our way. He wants us to expect to win at the game of life.\r
But most of us don’t come by that attitude easily. We’re so accustomed to losing that we have to totally change our way of thinking if we want to have a winning mind-set. In Ephesians, the Apostle Paul told the Church to renew their minds. Like us, they needed to change their attitudes, to renew their minds to the fact that Jesus overcame the world.\r

First John 5:5 puts it this way, “Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?”\r

We stay with Him a short time, only to wake up to our own realities of life. Our self-interest rises up and our abiding with Him is passed. Yet there is no circumstance of life in which we cannot abide in Jesus.\r
“You are Simon….You shall be called Cephas” (John 1:42). God writes our new name only on those places in our lives where He has erased our pride, self-sufficiency, and self-interest.

When we are in our best spiritual mood, you would think we were the highest quality saints. But don’t dare look at us when we are not in that mood. A true disciple is one who has his new name written all over him— self-interest, pride, and self-sufficiency has been completely erased.\r
Pride is the sin of making “self” our god. And some of us today do this, not like the Pharisee, but like the tax collector (see Luke 18:9-14). For you to say, “Oh, I’m no saint,” is acceptable by human standards of pride, but it is unconscious blasphemy against God. You defy God to make you a saint, as if to say, “I am too weak and hopeless and outside the reach of the atonement by the Cross of Christ.” Why aren’t you a saint? It is either that you do not want to be a saint, or that you do not believe that God can make you into one. You say it would be all right if God saved you and took you straight to heaven. That is exactly what He will do! And not only do we make our home with Him, but Jesus said of His Father and Himself, “…We will come to him and make Our home with him” (John 14:23).

Where our individual desire dies and sanctified surrender lives. One of the greatest hindrances in coming to Jesus is the excuse of our own individual temperament. We make our temperament and our natural desires barriers to coming to Jesus. Yet the first thing we realise when we do come to Jesus is that He pays no attention whatsoever to our natural desires. We have the idea that we can dedicate our gifts to God. However, you cannot dedicate what is not yours. There is actually only one thing you can dedicate to God, and that is your right to yourself (see Romans 12:1). If you will give God your right to yourself, He will make a holy experiment out of you— and His experiments always succeed. The one true mark of a saint of God is the inner creativity that flows from being totally surrendered to Jesus Christ. In the life of a saint, there is this amazing Well, which is a continual Source of original life. The Spirit of God is a Well of water springing up perpetually fresh. A saint realises that it is God who engineers his circumstances; consequently, there are no complaints, only unrestrained surrender to Jesus. Never try to make your experience a principle for others, but allow God to be as creative and original with others as He is with you.\r
If you abandon everything to Jesus and come when He says, “Come,” then He will continue to say, “Come,” through you. You will go out into the world reproducing the echo of Christ’s “Come.” That is the result in every soul who has abandoned all and come to Jesus.\r

 In the matter of determination. The Spirit of Jesus is put into me by way of the atonement by the Cross of Christ. I then have to build my thinking patiently to bring it into perfect harmony with my Lord. God will not make me think like Jesus— I have to do it myself. I have to bring “every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:5). “Abide in Me”— in intellectual matters, in money matters, in every one of the matters that make human life what it is. Our lives are not made up of only one neatly confined area.\r
Am I preventing God from doing things in my circumstances by saying that it will only serve to hinder my fellowship with Him? How irrelevant and disrespectful that is! It does not matter what my circumstances are. I can be as much assured of abiding in Jesus in any one of them as I am in any prayer meeting. It is unnecessary to change and arrange my circumstances myself. Our Lord’s inner abiding was pure and unblemished. He was at home with God wherever His body was. He never chose His own circumstances, but was meek, submitting to His Father’s plans and directions for Him. Just think of how amazingly relaxed our Lord’s life was! But we tend to keep God at a fever pitch in our lives. We have none of the serenity of the life which is “hidden with Christ in God” (Colossians 3:3).\r
Think of the things that take you out of the position of abiding in Christ. You say, “Yes, Lord, just a minute— I still have this to do. Yes, I will abide as soon as this is finished, or as soon as this week is over. It will be all right, Lord. I will abide then.” Get moving— begin to abide now. In the initial stages it will be a continual effort to abide, but as you continue, it will become so much a part of your life that you will abide in Him without any conscious effort.

It depends on how many you expect to receive. When God measures them out to you, He’ll be using your measuring stick, not His own. He always works that way.\r
Two people can hear God’s Word about healing, for example. One will measure it with faith. “Praise God, by His stripes I was healed!” he’ll say. “I believe that with all my heart, and I’m going to keep on believing it until I receive my healing.”\r
The other will measure it with skepticism. “I don’t care what Bible verses he comes up with,” he’ll say. “I just don’t trust that preacher. I’ll give this healing stuff a try, but I doubt very much if anything’s going to come of it.”\r
Both of those people will get exactly what they expect. God will measure to them just as they measured the Word. One will get healed...the other won’t.\r
I must warn you though, sometimes measuring the Word with faith is hard. Years ago, when Gloria first read the scripture, “Owe no man anything,” it was tempting for her to measure it as a curse, not a blessing. We were living in a terrible little house at the time, and she wanted a new one more than just about anything.\r
How were we ever going to buy a decent house without borrowing? It didn’t seem possible. So, to her, it was as if that scripture had said, “Gloria, you can’t have a new house.”\r
But she refused to measure it that way. She grabbed the devil by the throat and said, “Look here now, you’re not going to cheat me out of my house.” Then she started believing that somehow God could provide her with a house debt free. Sure enough, He did.\r
If you want to receive blessings by the bushel load, start going to the Word with a bushel basket. Put a big measure of faith in the hand of God. He’ll fill it to overflowing and give it right back to you!\r

When God gives you a vision for your life, it’ll burn within you like a fire that can’t be extinguished. The psalmist said, ‘My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned.’ So, what are you passionate about? What burns ‘hot’ within you? When God calls you to do something, He creates within you both the desire to do it and the power to carry it out. Though you feel inadequate and unqualified, stand on His Word: ‘For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him’ (Philippians 2:13 NLT). Mahatma Gandhi had a vision of a free and independent India at a time when it was governed by the British. Henry Ford had a vision of every family in America owning the automobile at a time when people were frightened of his new invention. Daniel K. Ludwig had a vision of a self-supporting industrial region in the heart of the Brazilian jungle at a time when there was no industry, no electricity, and no city of any kind for hundreds of miles. Where do such creative desires come from? God, Who is our Creator! And when God gives you a true worldview, you’ll never be happy living in a narrow mental framework. Are there times when you’ll feel afraid and uncertain about what to do? Yes! Fear and faith are two sides of the same coin, and they’ll always be part of your thinking.

1 Corinthians 13:8\r
The Bible says, ‘Love never fails.’ Think about it: money doesn’t bring happiness, fame doesn’t bring self-worth, and revenge doesn’t bring satisfaction. The only thing that never fails is love. When Mother Teresa addressed world leaders at the United Nations, she was asked, ‘How can we have world peace?’ She replied, ‘Go home and love your family.’ If we all did that, ‘Paradise Lost’ would become ‘Paradise Found’! Napoleon Bonaparte’s intellectual greatness and intense egotism make his alleged tribute to the supremacy of leadership by love, all the more striking. He said, ‘Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, and I myself founded great empires: but upon what did the creations of our genius depend on ? Upon force. Jesus alone founded His empire upon love, and to this day millions would die for Him.’ Sometimes leaders are just power-holders. Because you can’t love others without making yourself vulnerable, they see expressing love as a weakness. But the fact is you can’t love and ‘keep all your options open’. To truly love - whether it’s your spouse, your children, or the people you lead - you must give yourself unreservedly in such a way that you can be hurt and even rejected. The fundamental principle on which power-holders operate is to protect themselves and everything they have. Whereas the fundamental principle of true leadership is to give of yourself with no holds barred. Love as an intrinsic characteristic of leadership seems outmoded, yet according to Scripture, it’s still the winning strategy. The Bible says, ‘God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind’ (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV). That’s why love is the winning strategy.\r

The love talked about in Scripture isn’t a sentimental emotion that gives you goose bumps. It’s compassion, caring, and concern for the well-being of another. It’s based on commitment, not convenience. It’s an act of your will, not a reflex of your emotions. Jesus asks a question that makes you stop in your tracks. ‘If you love only those who love you, why should you get credit for that? Even sinners love those who love them! And if you do good only to those who do good to you, why should you get credit?’ (vs. 32-33 NLT). Loving is the hardest thing you’ll ever do, and it will require all the grace God can give you. Jesus continues: ‘Love your enemies! Do good to them! Lend to them without expecting to be repaid. Then your reward from heaven will be very great, and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High, for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked. You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate. Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn others, or it will all come back to you. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven. Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full - pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over … The amount you give will determine the amount you get back’ (vv. 35-38 NLT).

One day Christ’s critics asked Him, ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ (v. 36 NIV 2011 Edition). His answer is a timely reminder to both leaders and followers; it includes those who sit in the pews and those who stand in the pulpit. ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart … all your soul and all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment’ (vv. 37-38 NIV 2011 Edition). As a leader you must never leave a question in anyone’s mind as to who is God - and who isn’t. Namely, yourself! God said, ‘You shall have no other gods before Me’ (Exodus 20:3 NKJV). And that’s important because you’re never in greater danger than when people begin to praise you. Yes, we must teach people to respect, honour, and reward good leadership, but the Christlike leader discourages adulation and shies away from the limelight. John the Baptist was so successful as a preacher that when he finished speaking, his audience flocked to Jesus. Speaking of it, Christ later said, in essence, ‘John, you did your job well!’ Apparently John agreed, for he said, ‘He must increase, but I must decrease’ (John 3:30 NKJV). Isaiah wrote, ‘In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up’ (Isaiah 6:1 NKJV). The king had to die before Isaiah saw the Lord. Only when a leader becomes impervious to applause and approval and dies to ego, is God glorified in his or her leadership. Indeed, when Christ alone is exalted, the God-called leader smiles and says, ‘Thank You, Lord - that’s how You intended it.’\r

As long as you are, you’ll remain vulnerable to people, circumstances, and economic conditions. But when you know God’s responsible for your success, what you gain you can maintain.

You say, ‘But that’s an Old Testament promise.’ Then here’s a New Testament one: ‘God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work’ (2 Corinthians 9:8 NIV 1984 Edition).\r

Psalm 23:1\r
\r
Why does the Bible compare us to sheep? Because they’re one of the most dependent creatures in the world; they must trust in the shepherd for everything they need. And that’s how God wants you to live: in dependence on Him. When you constantly live in the fear of lack, you’re not trusting God enough. This core fear drives many of our other fears, including the fear of becoming disabled, or the fear of ageing, or the fear of investing, or the fear of retiring poor. In its extreme form, fear of lack can lead to anxiety that requires you to live on antidepressants or other medication. It’s also one of the root causes of greed. You can become so obsessed with insuring yourself against the possibility of not having enough, that you hoard more than you’ll ever need. It can drive you to become a workaholic so that neither you nor your children will ever experience discomfort, inconvenience, and helplessness. And like all fears, it’s based on an erroneous belief about God - in particular, His ability and willingness to take care of you. ‘The Lord is my Shepherd [to feed, guide, and shield me], I shall not lack.’ Stop living as though you don’t believe what God has promised you! A good strategy is to learn the promises, understand the ones that are conditional, meet the conditions, and rest in His love and faithfulness. This doesn’t mean you sit idly by and wait for God to do what He has given you the ability to do. You must do the natural things, and trust Him for the supernatural ones.\r

\r
Here are some scriptural strategies for conquering your fear of lack: 1) Give God the first tenth of your income (see Malachi 3:8-12; Matthew 23:23). Don’t debate whether it’s an Old Testament rule versus a New Testament requirement. Wouldn’t you rather do more than required, then find out later that you fell short of God’s expectations? 2) Live by the 10-10-80 rule. After you give God the first 10 percent of your income, put the second 10 percent into savings and budget yourself to live on the remaining 80 percent. 3) Confront the areas in which your fear of lack is the greatest. Food? Housing? Transportation? Health insurance? Retirement? Now cast down those imaginations and replace them with this promise: ‘God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others’ (2 Corinthians 9:8 NLT). 4) Refuse to rely solely on your credentials, marketable skills, or influential contacts for the assurance of your financial provision. ‘Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us.’ Maximise your personal power, but trust ultimately in God’s power alone. Jesus said, ‘I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full’ (John 10:10 NIV 2011 Edition). That’s not just ‘spiritual’ life, but every aspect of life. Today, believe and receive what Jesus promised by faith, and begin to live ‘to the full’.\r

1 Corinthians 13:4-5\r
\r
Here are some pointers to help you solve your relationship difficulties: 1) When it’s about money. How you manage money within a marriage depends on the set of skills you’ve developed and the amount of discipline you’ve exercised. One of you may be a saver and the other a spender. So you have to work together to make joint decisions that affect both of you, and work within the boundaries of your reality together. Consider how much debt you have, how much income, and how much you need to save. Find a way to achieve financial freedom. The Bible says, ‘The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is a servant to the lender’ (Proverbs 22:7 NKJV). 2) When it’s about time. If you’re not spending time together - one of you is missing the other. Ideally, you both want to spend more time together. But if your partner keeps making this complaint, take it as a compliment that he or she still enjoys your company. Schedule designated times together on both your calendars - with no intrusions. There’s no substitute for spending time with your mate. 3) When it’s about jealousy. We’re not talking about a possessive spouse who won’t allow you to glance at the waiter without accusing you of cheating. But generally, when there’s jealousy in a relationship it’s an indication of insecurity. You may need to have a frank discussion about your commitment to each other. Talk about the little habits and mannerisms your spouse interprets as flirtatious. Communicate, and don’t allow the jealousy to grow into bitterness, distrust, or disgust.\r

Some skeptics view the table of nations in Genesis 10 this way. Seventy names are listed along with the nations that proceeded from Noah’s descendants. The biblical narrator does not give any indication, however, that this list is legendary or allegorical. The list includes the names of individuals along with some of their accomplishments, including some of the greatest cities in biblical history.\r
\r
The purpose of the list is to set the stage for the destruction of the Tower of Babel. The overall impression is one of proliferation and growing ambition. In the next chapter this will culminate in an arrogant attempt to supplant God Himself.\r
\r
Instead of multiplying and filling the earth as they had been commanded (see Gen. 9:1, 7), the men of Babel chose to build a monument to themselves in the form of a city with a tower that reached to the heavens (Gen. 11:4). The function of this tower does not appear to have been for the purpose of worshiping God or even astrological deities. Instead, it was part of their project of self-worship. They were more intent on making a name for themselves than they were on glorifying God’s name. God thwarted their plan by destroying their tower, confusing their language, and scattering the people. This judgment was also a blessing, for it halted their rebellion.\r
\r
This curse was reversed on the day of Pentecost—not by restoring everyone to a single language, but by allowing everyone to declare the wonders of God in the langue of “every nation under heaven” (Acts 2:5). Despite mankind’s rebellion, God continues to work out His ultimate purpose for His creation. The whole earth will be filled with His glory."
"Father Abraham","Moody Global Ministries","""2016-06-09T17:08:18.644Z""","""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z""","A popular children’s song begins, “Father Abraham had many sons / and many sons had Father Abraham.” The Scriptures name eight sons of Abraham. One was his child with his maid Hagar (Gen. 16:3–4). Another was his son with Sarah (Gen. 21:1–3). The other six were born to Keturah, the woman he married after Sarah died (Gen. 25:1–6). But we don’t sing about “Father Abraham” because he gave birth to numerous sons. More importantly, he is our father in the faith.\r
\r
Today’s passage shows why Abraham deserves this title: not because of his parenting skills but because of his faith. Up until this point Abraham had relied on God to provide for his needs (see Gen. 14:21–24). But he was troubled\r
by his lack of an heir, despite God’s promise to make him a great nation (Gen. 12:2). The Lord reiterated His promise in a vision, and Abraham’s response was one of faith (vv. 5–6). Because of his faith, the Lord rewarded him with the gift of righteousness. In this way Abraham became the prototype of all who believe (see Rom. 4:3; Gal. 3:6; James 2:23).\r
\r
Abraham continued to struggle with doubt. His son by Hagar was the result of an attempt to bring about God’s promise through human effort. But in the end, he “was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised” (Rom. 4:20–21). God waited until Abraham and Sarah were too old to have children by any means other than divine intervention to show that the promise came from God.\r

\r
In the matter of drudgery. Peter said in this passage that we have become “partakers of the divine nature” and that we should now be “giving all diligence,” concentrating on forming godly habits (2 Peter 1:4-5). We are to “add” to our lives all that character means. No one is born either naturally or supernaturally with character; it must be developed. Nor are we born with habits— we have to form godly habits on the basis of the new life God has placed within us. We are not meant to be seen as God’s perfect, bright-shining examples, but to be seen as the everyday essence of ordinary life exhibiting the miracle of His grace. Drudgery is the test of genuine character. The greatest hindrance to our spiritual life is that we will only look for big things to do. Yet, “Jesus…took a towel and…began to wash the disciples’ feet…” (John 13:3-5).\r
We all have those times when there are no flashes of light and no apparent thrill to life, where we experience nothing but the daily routine with its common everyday tasks. The routine of life is actually God’s way of saving us between our times of great inspiration which come from Him. Don’t always expect God to give you His thrilling moments, but learn to live in those common times of the drudgery of life by the power of God.\r
It is difficult for us to do the “adding” that Peter mentioned here. We say we do not expect God to take us to heaven on flowery beds of ease, and yet we act as if we do! I must realise that my obedience even in the smallest detail of life has all of the omnipotent power of the grace of God behind it.

In part, this strangeness is due to cultural differences and different customs— few of us are nomadic or live in vast, extended family tribes. But in addition, the strangeness of Abraham’s family is that God was using them as a kind of living parable, providing lessons in following God for future generations.\r
\r
Ishmael was the firstborn son of Abraham—but he was not the son God had promised. Perhaps he felt insecure as the son of Sarah’s servant, or he may have discerned that Abraham felt differently toward Isaac than he did toward Ishmael. Ishmael was likely aware that Isaac had a special place in God’s plan. For whatever reason— perhaps even just plain brotherly teasing—he mocked Isaac, and Sarah saw it and demanded that Abraham banish both Ishmael and Hagar from the household.\r
\r
Despite Abraham’s reluctance to cast out his son, God confirmed Sarah’s harsh sentence but also promised Abraham that He would care for Ishmael. God dealt compassionately with Hagar and Ishmael by providing for their needs and making Ishmael into a great nation. But it was Isaac who was the child of promise.\r
\r
In Galatians 4:28–30 Paul reveals the spiritual lesson in these events. The only way to become a child of God is by way of promise, not through human effort. We cannot become God’s children by trying to obey His commands or solve the problem of sin on our own terms. Righteousness only comes to us as a gift through faith. Like Abraham and Sarah, God must do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. Those who try to obtain righteousness by keeping the law are slaves to the law and to sin. The law cannot free us from sin.\r

When his son was diagnosed with liver disease, Rounds volunteered to donate 30 percent of his liver. Rounds not only saved his son’s life but also became the first African- American live transplant donor in the state of Wisconsin.\r
\r
Abraham was asked to make a different kind of sacrifice. God asked him literally to sacrifice his son Isaac. The demand must have seemed strange to Abraham. Isaac was the child through whom God had promised to make Abraham a father of many nations. Yet as far as we are told in Scripture, Abraham did not argue with God. The author of Hebrews tells us why: because of faith in God’s trustworthiness, not mindless obedience. Abraham believed that God was able to raise his son from the dead (Heb. 11:19). God never intended that Abraham would go through with the slaughter; instead, He wanted to make a point: “Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son” (Gen. 22:12).\r
\r
Is it possible to love God’s promises more than God Himself? We can be so distracted by the things God provides that we lose sight of God. When this happens, God may ask us to choose. The language God uses to describe Isaac reveals the importance of this test for Abraham. God calls him Abraham’s “only son” in verse 2. This was not technically true; as we have already seen, Abraham had another son by Sarah’s maid Hagar. But this designation underscored the uniqueness of Isaac both in Abraham’s affection and in God’s plan. Isaac was Abraham’s unique son. He was the child of promise."

to those in coach: “The first-class passengers were served gourmet food on china and crystal by their own flight attendants; those of us in coach ate snacks served in paper bags with plastic wrappers,” Ortberg writes. “The first- class passengers had room to stretch and sleep; those of us in coach were sitting with a proximity usually reserved for engaged couples in the back row of a movie.” Preferential treatment is a common feature of human behavior.\r

What about God? In today’s passage we learn that God’s plan for Jacob differed from His plan for Esau. Both would become the father of a nation, but the younger brother was to have supremacy. This plan violated cultural norms. In Isaac’s day, the right of inheritance was reserved for the firstborn.\r
\r
What is the difference between grace and favoritism? The chief difference is that favoritism is based on some perceived advantage inherent in the one who is treated differently. It may be wealth, social status, or simply the fact that the one who is treated as a favorite is part of the same club. Grace is not bestowed on the basis of personal worth. Jacob did not deserve the primary place in God’s plan. Isaac and Rebekah demonstrated favoritism in their attitude toward their sons, preferring the child who shared their own interests. God does not show favoritism, but neither does He treat everyone the same. We are not all granted the same abilities, resources, or opportunities. God showed grace in His promise to Jacob, who had done nothing to deserve it, because of His own plans for His people."

In today’s passage we have an example of a backhanded blessing. Isaac blessed Esau as requested—but not with the blessing that Esau wanted. The blessing came after Isaac had given Jacob the blessing originally intended for Esau, the firstborn. At the instigation of his mother, Jacob had disguised himself as his brother in order to steal the blessing that God had already promised to him, taking advantage of his father’s failing eyesight.\r
\r
Isaac discovered the deceit when Esau came to him for the blessing he had already unwittingly bestowed on Jacob. Jacob’s behavior was deceitful, but Esau’s complaint about him was not entirely honest, either. Jacob did not take the birthright; Esau had carelessly sold it to him for a single meal (Gen. 25:29–34). Esau despised his birthright and showed contempt for God (Gen. 25:34; Heb. 12:16–17).\r
\r
We can see the destructive power of parental favoritism at work in this story, but amazingly we also see God working in the midst of this dysfunctional family to accomplish His plan. He is not yet finished working with Jacob, the deceitful schemer. And despite Esau’s godless attitude, he did receive a genuine blessing. Isaac’s backhanded blessing concludes with the promise that Esau’s descendants would eventually throw off the yoke of subjugation.\r
\r
Old Testament commentator Derek Kidner describes Esau’s blessing as “the appropriate destiny of the ‘profane person’: the freedom to live unblessed and untamed.” John Calvin similarly noted that the “unbridled liberty of Esau was more wretched than any state of subjection.” For some who have scorned His promises and priorities, God’s worst judgment may be to grant us our heart’s desire."

Some scholars have seen elements of the trickster in Jacob. He was a man who survived by cunning and deceit. But in today’s text Jacob the Trickster meets his match—both in love and war.\r
\r
Today’s passage is a love story, describing how Jacob fell in love with Rachel but was tricked into marrying Leah by their father, Laban. Why would a father do such a thing to his daughter? Laban’s explanation was that it was not customary for the younger daughter to marry first. This was probably true, but Laban also had another motive. By deceiving the deceiver, Laban tricked Jacob into giving him fourteen years of service instead of seven.\r
\r
Family drama fills this account. Laban uses his own daughters to barter for Jacob’s services. Rachel is loved more than Leah. Yet once again we will see that God is working out His purposes in the midst of what most of us would call serious family dysfunction.\r
\r
As for Jacob, this turn of events was part of God’s long process of taming the trickster and turning him into a man of faith. Jacob’s trials were far from over. But by turning the tables on him, God had begun to wean Jacob away from a lifestyle of self-reliance. In time Jacob would learn that God’s promise comes by faith and not by human effort, schemes, or trickery. \r

Parents who had a second child were fined and could even lose their jobs. The Chinese government made the recent change in the hope that it would help with China’s rapidly aging population and improve the gender balance.\r
\r
The battle between Jacob’s two wives reveals the opposite cultural value: a woman’s worth was based on her ability to have children. The inability to bear children was considered a mark of shame. In Jacob’s family, this shame was even more acute, and the tension between Rachel and Leah further aggravated by Jacob’s preference for Rachel. This resulted in what might be called “the battle of the babies.”\r
\r
Rachel and Leah vied with one another and even schemed to see who would have the most children. Some of their plots seem reminiscent of Abraham and Sarah’s attempt to force God’s hand through human effort. God had promised to use Jacob’s family line to fulfill the promise made to Abraham that he would be the father of nations. Both Leah and Rachel wanted to be the mother God used to keep that promise.\r
\r
God granted children to both, but not because of their schemes. His actions were motivated by compassion for the two women and in response to their prayers (Gen. 29:31; 30:6).

\r
So the LORD said to him, ""Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold."" And the LORD appointed a sign for Cain, lest anyone finding him should slay him. \r

Then Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden (Genesis 4:13-16).\r

When the Lord told Cain how he could be delivered from depression he did not listen. When we do not heed the Lord, it will usually result in our falling even further into sin, just as it did with Cain. Cain still could have turned to the Lord, humbled himself, and repented, and he would have received help. The Lord warned him that he had to master the sin, but he continued down the path of letting his sin master him.\r
\r
It is interesting that, even then, Cain understood the law of sowing and reaping, which Paul explained in Galatians 6:7: ""Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap."" He knew that because he had murdered his brother, he was in danger of being murdered himself. This is a law that is as sure as the law of gravity. Therefore, if we want to receive grace, we should learn to sow grace every chance that we get. If we want to receive mercy, we should learn to sow mercy every chance we get. If we do good, we will reap good. If we do evil, we will reap the same.\r

They did begin to fulfil their commission to multiply and fill the earth, having many other sons and daughters. Obviously, there was already a population on the earth by the time Cain slew Abel. They were obviously close relatives to Cain, but he was still afraid of them. He had slain his own brother, so he knew that a brother could slay him. This was accurate enough, because all men ultimately derive their name from the same family, but that has never kept them from attacking one another.\r
\r
Even so, the Lord had mercy on Cain. He gave him a mark that would serve to protect him. Throughout the history of God's dealings with mankind, He has been quick to show unmerited grace and mercy to us. His grace and mercy is even enough for Him to negate the law of sowing and reaping. Throughout the Scriptures, we have many examples of the Lord causing crop failures from the evil seeds men have sown. However, we also have examples of swift judgement for those who have hardened their hearts and presumed upon His grace and mercy.\r
\r
The worst result of Cain's sin of murdering his brother was that he ""went out from the presence of the Lord."" When fighting occurs between brethren in churches, or between churches, this is often the ultimate result. Many will end up actually departing from the Lord. That is why from the very beginning, one of the enemy's primary strategies has been to get brothers to fight with each other. He is called ""the accuser of our brethren"" (see Revelation 12:10), because one of his most effective weapons against us is to get us accusing one another.\r
\r
Cain somehow thought that Abel was the reason for his rejection. The rejection of Cain's offering had nothing to do with Abel's offering. The answer to Cain's problem had nothing to do with Abel, but with himself. However, from the beginning, blaming someone else for our own problems has been one of the primary deceptions that has kept men from the grace of God. It has also led to the most destructive wars in history, and it has led to the most destructive wars between churches in history.\r
\r
First, the enemy will try to get us to be jealous of others. Then he will get us to accuse them of being the reason for our own problems. That is why nations that are having serious difficulties become so dangerous. It often seems much easier to blame someone else and attack them instead of dealing with our own problems. People will tend to rally around us if we can portray a common enemy that is causing our problems. Churches and people can become dangerous when they start having serious problems. If you see them starting to attack and blame others, it is time to depart. We must not continue to get caught in this trap of the enemy, which is the seemingly cheap escape from dealing with our own shortcomings. It will lead us to needlessly wounding others. Even worse than that, it will also lead us to ""departing from the presence of the Lord."

""Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands"" (Job 14:15).\r
Agronomists and scientists say that times of drought are not disastrous after all.

Put in a spiritual perspective, suffering can lead us beyond our ordinary acceptance of truth to complete dependence on God for hope, life and safety. This is what Job's concluding remarks to the submission of one of his friend's demonstrate. The mourners who showed up at Job's home to sympathise with him were of little help to relieve him of the catastrophe that has come his way. They rather infuriated him, insisting his sin caught up with him. His wife also provoked him, asking him to curse God and die. Estrangement from the Almighty and final death appeared to be better than the state in which Job found himself. It was in the midst of these despairing and death-sentencing circumstances that God enabled him to discover the ultimate truth. It is very much like the tree in the time of drought when it digs deeper for survival. Job also, in his moment of need, saw the glorious which New Testament believers know as Resurrection when God ""shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself"" (Phillippians. 3:21). The great truth is that, it is not sufficient to flaunt our knowledge of the Scriptures as Christians. To claim to know Him and the doctrines of the Bible is not enough in our walk with God. This knowledge must be weighed in the balance of life's experiences.

While some are looking up to God for healing, others are looking for deliverance from satanic afflictions, and some are struggling from self and sin. The Name of Jesus is a universal cure for all problems. If you believe in Jesus, no matter how hopeless your situation and condition maybe, there will be a supernatural intervention in your life.\r
\r
Every believer carries a measure of God’s glory. However, as we walk with God, we realise that the glory of God is in different phases, and God expects us to move from one level of glory to another consistently. In Christ, there is only a starting point but there is no end to the activation of His glory and wonders in our lives. All we need to do is believe Him and follow as He leads. Prayer precedes penetration into certain realms of God’s glory. Performing wonders is easy when the glory of God saturates our lives."

Good relationships are impossible unless we are generous with mercy and forgiveness. Being merciful simply means forgiving others even though their actions would warrant our anger. \r

The psalmist said, ‘My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned.’ So, what lights your fire? What burns ‘hot’ within you? When God calls you to do something, He creates within you both the desire to do it and the power to carry it out. Though you feel inadequate and unqualified, stand on His Word: ‘For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases Him.’ (Philippians 2:13 NLT) Mahatma Gandhi had a vision of a free and independent India at a time when it was governed by the British. Henry Ford had a vision of every family in America owning an automobile at a time when people were frightened of his new invention. Daniel K. Ludwig had a vision of a self-supporting industrial region in the heart of the Brazilian jungle at a time when there was no industry, no electricity, and no city of any kind for hundreds of kilometres. Where do such creative desires come from? God, Who is our Creator! And when God gives you a wide-blue-sky mindset, you’ll never be happy living in a mental birdcage. Are there times when you’ll feel afraid and uncertain about what to do? Yes! Fear and faith are two sides of the same coin, and they’ll always be part of your thinking.

We derive great pleasure from doing what we’re naturally good at doing. So if you aren’t sure of your life’s purpose, just do what you do well and watch God confirm it by blessing your endeavours. Don’t spend your time trying to do what you’re not gifted to do, or what somebody else is good at. We know we’re operating in our gifts and calling when what we do ministers life to others. If what we do makes us miserable and fills us with a sense of dread, usually we’re not in God’s perfect will. He gives us peace and joy to let us know we’re fulfilling His perfect plan: ‘For you shall go out with joy, and be led out with peace.’ Look at what you enjoy, what you’re good at, and what God is giving you the grace to do—then let God be God in your life.

The Bible says, ‘Love never fails.’ Think about it: money doesn’t bring happiness, fame doesn’t bring self-worth, and revenge doesn’t bring satisfaction. The only thing that never fails is love. When Mother Teresa addressed world leaders at the United Nations, she was asked, ‘How can we have world peace?’ She replied, ‘Go home and love your family.’ If we all did that, ‘Paradise Lost’ would become ‘Paradise Found’! Napoleon Bonaparte’s intellectual greatness and intense egotism make his alleged tribute to the supremacy of leadership by love all the more striking. He said, ‘Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne and I myself founded great empires: but upon what did the creations of our genius depend? Upon force. Jesus alone founded His empire upon love, and to this day millions would die for Him.’ Sometimes leaders are just power-holders. Because you can’t love others without making yourself vulnerable, they see expressing love as a weakness. But the fact is you can’t love and ‘keep all your options open’. To truly love—whether it’s your spouse, your children, or the people you lead—you must give yourself unreservedly in such a way that you can be hurt and even rejected. The fundamental principle on which power-holders operate is to protect themselves and everything they have. Whereas the fundamental principle of true leadership is to give of yourself with no holds barred. Love as an intrinsic characteristic of leadership seems outmoded, yet according to Scripture it’s still the winning strategy. The Bible says, ‘God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.’ (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV) That’s why love is the winning strategy.\r

You are royalty. You have been made kings and priests unto God. The reason the devil runs roughshod over you is because you have refused to understand this fact and to behave like royalty. There are environments in which you can't find a worldly prince because he is royalty. There are ways in which he can't talk. There are movies he can't watch because he does not want his mind to be twisted. There is music he does not listen to. There are books he will not read. He lives his life by virtue of who he is. He lives his life conscious of the fact that he is royalty. Because he is born royalty, others will train him and guide him to live the life of royalty. He is uncommon, so he can't function like a common man.\r
 \r
The word 'common' means ordinary, inferior, lacking distinction, mean, low, lacking in rank, and not exceptional. Why would you function like a common man when God has elevated you? Ephesians 2:4-6 (KJV) says, ""But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) And hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus"".\r
 \r
For too long the church has been a misrepresentation of royalty. That is why it appears as if we don't have the authority to declare things and have them carried out. Because the devil says, ""What do you mean, you are like me? What right do you have to tell me what to do? There is no difference between us. You live like me."" Child of God, you are royalty! So stop living life frivolously. Take responsibility for your life. You are the extension of God in your world. You are His righteousness. You are His beloved. Square up your shoulders, knowing who you are. It's your assignment. Understand that you are royalty and live like royalty.\r

 Am I fulfilling this ministry of intercession deep within the hidden recesses of my life? There is no trap nor any danger at all of being deceived or of showing pride in true intercession. It is a hidden ministry that brings forth fruit through which the Father is glorified. Am I allowing my spiritual life to waste away, or am I focused, bringing everything to one central point— the atonement of my Lord? Is Jesus Christ more and more dominating every interest of my life? If the central point, or the most powerful influence, of my life, is the atonement of the Lord, then every aspect of my life will bear fruit for Him.\r
However, I must take the time to realise what this central point of power is. Am I willing to give one minute out of every hour to concentrate on it? “If you abide in Me…”— that is if you continue to act, and think, and work from that central point— “you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you” (John 15:7). Am I abiding? Am I taking the time to abide? What is the greatest source of power in my life? Is it my work, service, and sacrifice for others, or is it my striving to work for God? It should be none of these— what ought to exert the greatest power in my life is the atonement of the Lord. It is not on what we spend the greatest amount of time that moulds us the most, but whatever exerts the most power over us. We must make a determination to limit and concentrate our desires and interests on the atonement by the Cross of Christ.\r
“Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do….” The disciple who abides in Jesus is the will of God, and what appears to be his free choices are actually God’s foreordained decrees.

To be carnally minded means that you are thinking like the rest of the world even though you are a spiritual person. As long as you want to dominate the material world in your flesh, you will never succeed, because there is a devil that is loosed on earth to hinder you.

In the early days of computers, they used to say, ""Garbage in, garbage out."" That was a way of explaining that the computer only worked with the data put into the machine. If we wanted different results, we needed to put in different information.\r
When it comes to computers, most people have no trouble grasping that concept, but when it comes to their minds, they don't seem to get it. Or perhaps they don't want to get it. So many things demand their attention and beg for their focus. They're not just sinful things. The apostle Paul said that although everything was lawful for him, not everything was helpful (see l Corinthians 6:12).\r
If you are going to win the battle of the mind and defeat your enemy, where you focus your attention is crucial. The more you meditate on God's Word, the stronger you'll become and the more easily you'll win the victories.\r
Too many Christians don't realise the difference between meditating on the Bible and reading the Bible. They like to think that whenever they read God's Word, they're absorbing the deep things of God. Too often people will read a chapter of the Bible, and when they get to the last verse, they have little idea of what they've read. Those who meditate on Gods Word are those who think and think seriously about what they're reading.\r
They may not put it in these words, but they are saying, ""God, speak to me. Teach me. As I ponder Your Word, reveal its depth to me.""\r
In today’s scripture, I quoted from Psalm 1. This psalm begins by defining the person who is blessed and then points out the right actions of that person. The psalmist wrote that those who meditate and do it day and night are like productive trees...and everything they do shall prosper.\r
The psalmist made it quite clear that meditating on and thinking about God's Word brings results. As you ponder who God is and what He’s saying to you, you'll grow. It's really that simple. Another way to put it is to say that whatever you focus on, you become. If you read about and allow your mind to focus on God's love and power, that's what operates in you.\r
The apostle Paul says it beautifully in Philippians 4:8: ...""Whatever is true, whatever is worthy of reverence and is honorable and seemly, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely and lovable, whatever is kind and winsome and gracious, if there are any virtue and excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think on and weigh and take account of these things [fix your minds on them].""\r
It's sad, but most Christians don't put much effort into their study of the Word_ They go to hear others teach and preach, and they may listen to sermon tapes and read the Bible occasionally, but they're not dedicated to making God's Word a major part of their lives.\r
Be careful what you think about. The more you think about good things, the better your life will seem. The more you think about Jesus Christ and the principles He taught, the more you become like Jesus and the stronger you grow And as you grow, you win the battle for your mind.\r
Lord God, help me think about the things that honour` You. Fill my life with a hunger for more of You and Your Word so that in everything I may prosper. I ask this through Jesus Christ. Amen.\r"

\r
Ask if you have not received. There is nothing more difficult than asking. We will have yearnings and desires for certain things, and even suffer as a result of their going unfulfilled, but not until we are at the limit of desperation will we ask. It is the sense of not being spiritually real that causes us to ask. Have you ever asked out of the depths of your total insufficiency and poverty? “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God…” (James 1:5), but be sure that you do lack wisdom before you ask. You cannot bring yourself to the point of spiritual reality anytime you choose. The best thing to do, once you realise you are not spiritually real, is to ask God for the Holy Spirit, basing your request on the promise of Jesus Christ (see Luke 11:13). The Holy Spirit is the one who makes everything that Jesus did for you real in your life.\r
“Everyone who asks receives….” This does not mean that you will not get if you do not ask, but it means that until you come to the point of asking, you will not receive from God (seeMatthew 5:45). To be able to receive means that you have to come into the relationship of a child of God, and then you comprehend and appreciate mentally, morally, and with spiritual understanding, that these things come from God.\r
“If any of you lacks wisdom….” If you realise that you are lacking, it is because you have come in contact with spiritual reality— do not put the blinders of reason on again. The word asks actually means “beg.” Some people are poor enough to be interested in their poverty, and some of us are poor enough spiritually to show our interest. Yet we will never receive if we ask with a certain result in mind because we are asking out of our lust, not out of our poverty. A pauper does not ask out of any reason other than the completely hopeless and painful condition of his poverty. He is not ashamed to beg— blessed are the paupers in spirit (see Matthew 5:3).\r

He told a few Christians they had to live like the world, sharing all the same misfortune, defeat, poverty and failure as those around them. Well, the word spread. You may have heard the rumor yourself. But I am telling you right now that it is a crafty lie.\r
The Word of God says in Psalm 91:10, that evil can’t even come near your house if you are abiding in Him.\r
In John 16, Jesus Himself says He has deprived the world of power to harm you. And Exodus 10:23 says that when thick darkness surrounded the Egyptians, the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\r
By these and other scriptures, you can see that God never intended you to experience all of the junk that the world suffers. He’s always wanted His children to live above it, to stand out as light in a dark world.\r
In the Old Testament, God’s fame was established because of the miracles He had worked for His children. That same thing should be true today with you and me. We should be glorifying God by the miraculously victorious lives we live. People should be coming up to us and saying things like, “I’ve heard how God healed you.” Or, “I’ve heard how your children were delivered from drugs,” or, “God has really brought you out of a financial crisis.”\r
Can you see now why Satan would spread a rumor that would make you believe you have to suffer with the world instead of live as victor over it? He doesn’t want people running after you asking where you get your power, your peace, your health and prosperity.\r
But that’s exactly what God wants to happen. So, put the Word of God to work and dare to receive the blessings He has promised to you. Let the light of God’s power in your life put the devil’s dark rumors to rest!\r"

Seek if you have not found. “You ask and do not receive because you ask amiss…” (James 4:3). If you ask for things from life instead of from God, “you ask amiss”; that is, you ask out of your desire for self-fulfillment. The more you fulfil yourself the less you will seek God. “…seek, and you will find….” Get to work— narrow your focus and interests to this one thing. Have you ever sought God with your whole heart, or have you simply given Him a feeble cry after some emotionally painful experience? “…seek, [focus,] and you will find….”\r
“Ho! Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters…” (Isaiah 55:1). Are you thirsty, or complacent and indifferent— so satisfied with your own experience that you want nothing more of God? Experience is a doorway, not a final goal. Beware of building your faith on experience, or your life will not ring true and will only sound the note of a critical spirit. Remember that you can never give another person what you have found, but you can cause him to have a desire for it.\r
“…knock, and it will be opened to you” (Luke 11:9). “Draw near to God…” (James 4:8). Knock— the door is closed, and your heartbeat races as you knock. “Cleanse your hands…” (James 4:8). Knock a bit louder— you begin to find that you are dirty. “…purify your hearts…” (James 4:8). It is becoming even more personal— you are desperate and serious now— you will do anything. “Lament…” (James 4:9). Have you ever lamented, expressing your sorrow before God for the condition of your inner life? There is no thread of self-pity left, only the heart-rending difficulty and amazement which comes from seeing what kind of person you really are. “Humble yourselves…” (James 4:10).

That may sound odd to you, especially if you don’t have much of an interest in the Word right now. But, believe me, it’s possible. I’ve done it myself and I’ve seen others do it, time and again.\r
All you have to do is make a decision to give yourself to it. To focus your time and attention on it. The more you give yourself to it, the more your desire for it will grow. Eventually, it will consume your thinking.\r
Surprised? You shouldn’t be. That happens with anything you totally give yourself to. It happens, for example, with people who give themselves to pornography. As they focus their attention on it, the spirit behind it moves in on their consciousness and eventually draws them from mental activity into physical activity. Finally, they come to a place where they can’t be satisfied. They can’t get enough.\r
That same principle works on the positive side when you begin to give yourself to God’s Word. You can give yourself to it to the point where it totally consumes your mental and physical life. The more of it you get, the more you want. The Spirit behind the Word, the Holy Spirit, will draw you and lead you closer to Jesus than you ever imagined possible.\r
I’ve never yet met anyone walking in faith and power who at some time hadn’t developed that kind of addiction by giving themselves totally to the Word for an extended time. I don’t mean just a few minutes here and there either. I’m talking about some serious time.\r

Warnings are wrapped in the posers, which are themselves very profound truths designed to teach deep Kingdom and relational realities. Can two walk together if they are not spiritually compatible? Would a Holy God entertain companionship with carnal man? No. The carnal man must first abandon his sinful way. If the Lion of the tribe of Judah should roar against sin, would the sinner not tremble and fear? And if the battle trumpet be blown, would there not be a flight for safety? Notwithstanding, there is God's assurance that even in anger He is merciful. What God is telling us is that He will always use His servants to issue warnings before moving in with judgments if the need arises. Can man then murmur when swift divine judgment follows the refusal to repent? We are the architect of the evil that accompanies sin, not God. The instructive takeaway of the lesson today is that the sinner and backslider as well as the careless Christian should not handle God's warning about the wrath to come with levity. God's admonitions are the Father's unique way of showing mercy to us. It is also a clarion call to the believer not to fall for the erroneous teaching of eternal security which assumes that a saved person can live a care-free life without watching against the possibility of backsliding. God's precepts are for all and sundry. Proverb 14:16 says it all: ""A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.""\r

It is perhaps the most destructive and the most widely accepted misinterpretation of Scripture that exists in the Body of Christ today. I’ve gone into countries to preach to people who hardly had any knowledge of the Word at all and still I have found that somehow they’d been taught about Paul’s thorn.\r
And most of them have been taught wrongly.\r
Tradition says that God gave Paul the thorn in the flesh. What’s more, tradition makes the “thorn” into some great mystery. But the Scripture doesn’t say that at all!\r
It says that the thorn in the flesh was a messenger of Satan. Not God—Satan! The thorn was quite literally just what Paul says it was—a “messenger sent from Satan.”\r
You see, everywhere Paul went, he preached the gospel and every time he preached, he destroyed a little more of Satan’s kingdom. So, Satan sent a messenger, an evil spirit, to stop him.\r
When Paul sought the Lord concerning this thorn (look at 2 Corinthians 12:8-10), God didn’t answer Paul in the negative. God said, “My grace (or, My favor) is enough. It is sufficient for you. For My strength is made perfect in your weakness (inability to produce results)” (W.E. Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words).\r
In other words, when Paul didn’t have enough human strength to overcome, God’s miracle-working power was sufficient for him. It enabled him to be an overcomer in spite of his weakness.\r
Don’t allow the devil to talk you out of your victory. Throw tradition aside and dare to believe the Word of God. Fight the fight of faith, and just like the Apostle Paul, you will see the salvation of the Lord!\r

Like faith, love becomes active through knowledge of the Word.\r

Many of us have learned to believe God to prosper us to such a degree that we have too much to keep up with. We end up spending so much time and energy taking care of the legitimate “things” of life that we unconsciously give the attention and affections of our heart over to this natural world instead of to God.\r
When Kenneth and I first heard about living by faith, we were in desperate circumstances. We were sick and broke, so it was easy for us to dedicate ourselves to prayer and to the Word. But as we honored God’s Word, He honored and prospered us. We came to the place where we were no longer desperate. Then came the real test of our faith. Would we serve God out of our love for Him instead of our desperation?\r
Well, praise God, we did. But in the process we found out one thing: It takes a lot more dedication to serve God when you’re prosperous than it takes when you’re desperate! There’s a constant temptation to get so caught up in the earthly things that your desire for the things of God fades into the background.\r
As the material blessings of God come your way, remember, God has not trained you in His Word so you can consume it on your own lusts. He has revealed His Word to you so you can walk in the spirit and do the job He’s called you to do.\r

Where sin and sorrow stops, and the song of the saint starts. Do I really want to get there? I can right now. The questions that truly matter in life are remarkably few, and they are all answered by these words— “Come to Me.” Our Lord’s words are not, “Do this, or don’t do that,” but— “Come to me.” If I will simply come to Jesus, my real life will be brought into harmony with my real desires. I will actually cease from sin, and will find the song of the Lord beginning in my life.\r
Have you ever come to Jesus? Look at the stubbornness of your heart. You would rather do anything than this one simple childlike thing— “Come to Me.” If you really want to experience ceasing from sin, you must come to Jesus.\r
Jesus Christ makes Himself the test to determine your genuineness. Look how He used the word come. At the most unexpected moments in your life there is this whisper of the Lord— “Come to Me,” and you are immediately drawn to Him. Personal contact with Jesus changes everything. Be “foolish” enough to come and commit yourself to what He says. The attitude necessary for you to come to Him is one where your will has made the determination to let go of everything and deliberately commit it all to Him.\r
“…and I will give you rest”— that is, “I will sustain you, causing you to stand firm.” He is not saying, “I will put you to bed, hold your hand, and sing you to sleep.” But, in essence, He is saying, “I will get you out of bed— out of your listlessness and exhaustion, and out of your condition of being half dead while you are still alive. I will penetrate you with the spirit of life, and you will be sustained by the perfection of vital activity.” Yet we become so weak and pitiful and talk about “suffering” the will of the Lord!

Any coach will tell you that part of playing the game right is having a winning attitude. That’s what God wants us, as believers, to have. He wants us to have so much faith in Him that we expect to whip any obstacle the devil brings our way. He wants us to expect to win at the game of life.\r
But most of us don’t come by that attitude easily. We’re so accustomed to losing that we have to totally change our way of thinking if we want to have a winning mind-set. In Ephesians, the Apostle Paul told the Church to renew their minds. Like us, they needed to change their attitudes, to renew their minds to the fact that Jesus overcame the world.\r

You defy God to make you a saint, as if to say, “I am too weak and hopeless and outside the reach of the atonement by the Cross of Christ.” Why aren’t you a saint? It is either that you do not want to be a saint, or that you do not believe that God can make you into one. You say it would be all right if God saved you and took you straight to heaven.

We have the idea that we can dedicate our gifts to God. However, you cannot dedicate what is not yours. There is actually only one thing you can dedicate to God, and that is your right to yourself (see Romans 12:1). If you will give God your right to yourself, He will make a holy experiment out of you— and His experiments always succeed. The one true mark of a saint of God is the inner creativity that flows from being totally surrendered to Jesus Christ. In the life of a saint, there is this amazing Well, which is a continual Source of original life. The Spirit of God is a Well of water springing up perpetually fresh. A saint realises that it is God who engineers his circumstances; consequently, there are no complaints, only unrestrained surrender to Jesus. Never try to make your experience a principle for others, but allow God to be as creative and original with others as He is with you.\r

I have to bring “every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:5). “Abide in Me”— in intellectual matters, in money matters, in every one of the matters that make human life what it is. Our lives are not made up of only one neatly confined area.\r
Am I preventing God from doing things in my circumstances by saying that it will only serve to hinder my fellowship with Him? How irrelevant and disrespectful that is! It does not matter what my circumstances are. I can be as much assured of abiding in Jesus in any one of them as I am in any prayer meeting. It is unnecessary to change and arrange my circumstances myself. Our Lord’s inner abiding was pure and unblemished. He was at home with God wherever His body was. He never chose His own circumstances, but was meek, submitting to His Father’s plans and directions for Him. Just think of how amazingly relaxed our Lord’s life was! But we tend to keep God at a fever pitch in our lives. We have none of the serenity of the life which is “hidden with Christ in God” (Colossians 3:3).\r
Think of the things that take you out of the position of abiding in Christ. You say, “Yes, Lord, just a minute— I still have this to do. Yes, I will abide as soon as this is finished, or as soon as this week is over. It will be all right, Lord. I will abide then.” Get moving— begin to abide now. In the initial stages it will be a continual effort to abide, but as you continue, it will become so much a part of your life that you will abide in Him without any conscious effort.

It depends on how many you expect to receive. When God measures them out to you, He’ll be using your measuring stick, not His own. He always works that way.\r
Two people can hear God’s Word about healing, for example. One will measure it with faith. “Praise God, by His stripes I was healed!” he’ll say. “I believe that with all my heart, and I’m going to keep on believing it until I receive my healing.”\r
The other will measure it with skepticism. “I don’t care what Bible verses he comes up with,” he’ll say. “I just don’t trust that preacher. I’ll give this healing stuff a try, but I doubt very much if anything’s going to come of it.”\r
Both of those people will get exactly what they expect. God will measure to them just as they measured the Word. One will get healed...the other won’t.\r
I must warn you though, sometimes measuring the Word with faith is hard. Years ago, when Gloria first read the scripture, “Owe no man anything,” it was tempting for her to measure it as a curse, not a blessing. We were living in a terrible little house at the time, and she wanted a new one more than just about anything.\r
How were we ever going to buy a decent house without borrowing? It didn’t seem possible. So, to her, it was as if that scripture had said, “Gloria, you can’t have a new house.”\r
But she refused to measure it that way. She grabbed the devil by the throat and said, “Look here now, you’re not going to cheat me out of my house.” Then she started believing that somehow God could provide her with a house debt free. Sure enough, He did.\r

The psalmist said, ‘My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned.’ So, what are you passionate about? What burns ‘hot’ within you? When God calls you to do something, He creates within you both the desire to do it and the power to carry it out. Though you feel inadequate and unqualified, stand on His Word: ‘For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him’ (Philippians 2:13 NLT). Mahatma Gandhi had a vision of a free and independent India at a time when it was governed by the British.

1 Corinthians 13:8\r
The Bible says, ‘Love never fails.’ Think about it: money doesn’t bring happiness, fame doesn’t bring self-worth, and revenge doesn’t bring satisfaction. The only thing that never fails is love. When Mother Teresa addressed world leaders at the United Nations, she was asked, ‘How can we have world peace?’ She replied, ‘Go home and love your family.’ If we all did that, ‘Paradise Lost’ would become ‘Paradise Found’! Napoleon Bonaparte’s intellectual greatness and intense egotism make his alleged tribute to the supremacy of leadership by love, all the more striking. He said, ‘Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, and I myself founded great empires: but upon what did the creations of our genius depend on ? Upon force. Jesus alone founded His empire upon love, and to this day millions would die for Him.’ Sometimes leaders are just power-holders. Because you can’t love others without making yourself vulnerable, they see expressing love as a weakness. But the fact is you can’t love and ‘keep all your options open’. To truly love - whether it’s your spouse, your children, or the people you lead - you must give yourself unreservedly in such a way that you can be hurt and even rejected. The fundamental principle on which power-holders operate is to protect themselves and everything they have. Whereas the fundamental principle of true leadership is to give of yourself with no holds barred. Love as an intrinsic characteristic of leadership seems outmoded, yet according to Scripture, it’s still the winning strategy. The Bible says, ‘God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind’ (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV). That’s why love is the winning strategy.\r

\r
The love talked about in Scripture isn’t a sentimental emotion that gives you goose bumps. It’s compassion, caring, and concern for the well-being of another. It’s based on commitment, not convenience. It’s an act of your will, not a reflex of your emotions. Jesus asks a question that makes you stop in your tracks. ‘If you love only those who love you, why should you get credit for that? Even sinners love those who love them! And if you do good only to those who do good to you, why should you get credit?’ (vs. 32-33 NLT). Loving is the hardest thing you’ll ever do, and it will require all the grace God can give you. Jesus continues: ‘Love your enemies! Do good to them! Lend to them without expecting to be repaid. Then your reward from heaven will be very great, and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High, for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked. You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate. Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn others, or it will all come back to you. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven. Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full - pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over … The amount you give will determine the amount you get back’ (vv. 35-38 NLT).

Matthew 22:37\r
\r
One day Christ’s critics asked Him, ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ (v. 36 NIV 2011 Edition). His answer is a timely reminder to both leaders and followers; it includes those who sit in the pews and those who stand in the pulpit. ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart … all your soul and all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment’ (vv. 37-38 NIV 2011 Edition). As a leader you must never leave a question in anyone’s mind as to who is God - and who isn’t. Namely, yourself! God said, ‘You shall have no other gods before Me’ (Exodus 20:3 NKJV). And that’s important because you’re never in greater danger than when people begin to praise you. Yes, we must teach people to respect, honour, and reward good leadership, but the Christlike leader discourages adulation and shies away from the limelight. John the Baptist was so successful as a preacher that when he finished speaking, his audience flocked to Jesus. Speaking of it, Christ later said, in essence, ‘John, you did your job well!’ Apparently John agreed, for he said, ‘He must increase, but I must decrease’ (John 3:30 NKJV). Isaiah wrote, ‘In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up’ (Isaiah 6:1 NKJV). The king had to die before Isaiah saw the Lord. Only when a leader becomes impervious to applause and approval and dies to ego, is God glorified in his or her leadership. Indeed, when Christ alone is exalted, the God-called leader smiles and says, ‘Thank You, Lord - that’s how You intended it.’\r

It’s okay to grow up in poverty, as long as poverty doesn’t grow up on you and control your thinking. One celebrity was asked how he felt about growing up in poverty. Amazingly, he confessed that he still suffered anxiety over having enough in the future. So he tended to be overly frugal, viewed his money as somewhat surreal, and wasn’t able to relax and enjoy the blessings that come with success. However, his wife had brought balance to the relationship with the mindset of giving, spend, and save. Who do you believe is responsible for your success, yourself or God? As long as you are, you’ll remain vulnerable to people, circumstances, and economic conditions. But when you know God’s responsible for your success, what you gain you can maintain. So your options are: trust yourself - or God! The psalmist writes: ‘There is no want to those who truly revere and worship Him with godly fear.

\r
Why does the Bible compare us to sheep? Because they’re one of the most dependent creatures in the world; they must trust in the shepherd for everything they need. And that’s how God wants you to live: in dependence on Him. When you constantly live in the fear of lack, you’re not trusting God enough. This core fear drives many of our other fears, including the fear of becoming disabled, or the fear of ageing, or the fear of investing, or the fear of retiring poor. In its extreme form, fear of lack can lead to anxiety that requires you to live on antidepressants or other medication. It’s also one of the root causes of greed. You can become so obsessed with insuring yourself against the possibility of not having enough, that you hoard more than you’ll ever need. It can drive you to become a workaholic so that neither you nor your children will ever experience discomfort, inconvenience, and helplessness. And like all fears, it’s based on an erroneous belief about God - in particular, His ability and willingness to take care of you. ‘The Lord is my Shepherd [to feed, guide, and shield me], I shall not lack.’ Stop living as though you don’t believe what God has promised you! A good strategy is to learn the promises, understand the ones that are conditional, meet the conditions, and rest in His love and faithfulness. This doesn’t mean you sit idly by and wait for God to do what He has given you the ability to do. You must do the natural things, and trust Him for the supernatural ones.\r

\r
Here are some scriptural strategies for conquering your fear of lack: 1) Give God the first tenth of your income (see Malachi 3:8-12; Matthew 23:23). Don’t debate whether it’s an Old Testament rule versus a New Testament requirement. Wouldn’t you rather do more than required, then find out later that you fell short of God’s expectations? 2) Live by the 10-10-80 rule. After you give God the first 10 percent of your income, put the second 10 percent into savings and budget yourself to live on the remaining 80 percent. 3) Confront the areas in which your fear of lack is the greatest. Food? Housing? Transportation? Health insurance? Retirement? Now cast down those imaginations and replace them with this promise: ‘God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others’ (2 Corinthians 9:8 NLT). 4) Refuse to rely solely on your credentials, marketable skills, or influential contacts for the assurance of your financial provision. ‘Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us.’ Maximise your personal power, but trust ultimately in God’s power alone. Jesus said, ‘I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full’ (John 10:10 NIV 2011 Edition). That’s not just ‘spiritual’ life, but every aspect of life.

The cross creates a new people: a people unhindered by skin colour or family feud. A new citizenry, based not on common ancestry or geography, but on a common Saviour. ‘Therefore, accept each other just as Christ has accepted you so that God will be given glory.’ So confront your prejudice and root out your biases. Pray: ’Lord, reveal them to me. How often do I judge someone unworthy of You, by the way, I treat him or her? Rebuke me in Your love.

1 Corinthians 13:4-5\r
\r
Here are some pointers to help you solve your relationship difficulties: 1) When it’s about money. How you manage money within a marriage depends on the set of skills you’ve developed and the amount of discipline you’ve exercised. One of you may be a saver and the other a spender. So you have to work together to make joint decisions that affect both of you, and work within the boundaries of your reality together. Consider how much debt you have, how much income, and how much you need to save. Find a way to achieve financial freedom. The Bible says, ‘The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is a servant to the lender’ (Proverbs 22:7 NKJV). 2) When it’s about time. If you’re not spending time together - one of you is missing the other. Ideally, you both want to spend more time together. But if your partner keeps making this complaint, take it as a compliment that he or she still enjoys your company. Schedule designated times together on both your calendars - with no intrusions. There’s no substitute for spending time with your mate. 3) When it’s about jealousy. We’re not talking about a possessive spouse who won’t allow you to glance at the waiter without accusing you of cheating. But generally, when there’s jealousy in a relationship it’s an indication of insecurity. You may need to have a frank discussion about your commitment to each other. Talk about the little habits and mannerisms your spouse interprets as flirtatious. Communicate, and don’t allow the jealousy to grow into bitterness, distrust, or disgust.\r

Some skeptics view the table of nations in Genesis 10 this way. Seventy names are listed along with the nations that proceeded from Noah’s descendants. The biblical narrator does not give any indication, however, that this list is legendary or allegorical. The list includes the names of individuals along with some of their accomplishments, including some of the greatest cities in biblical history.\r
\r
The purpose of the list is to set the stage for the destruction of the Tower of Babel. The overall impression is one of proliferation and growing ambition. In the next chapter this will culminate in an arrogant attempt to supplant God Himself.\r
\r
Instead of multiplying and filling the earth as they had been commanded (see Gen. 9:1, 7), the men of Babel chose to build a monument to themselves in the form of a city with a tower that reached to the heavens (Gen. 11:4). The function of this tower does not appear to have been for the purpose of worshiping God or even astrological deities. Instead, it was part of their project of self-worship. They were more intent on making a name for themselves than they were on glorifying God’s name. God thwarted their plan by destroying their tower, confusing their language, and scattering the people. This judgment was also a blessing, for it halted their rebellion.\r
\r
This curse was reversed on the day of Pentecost—not by restoring everyone to a single language, but by allowing everyone to declare the wonders of God in the langue of “every nation under heaven” (Acts 2:5). Despite mankind’s rebellion, God continues to work out His ultimate purpose for His creation. The whole earth will be filled with His glory."

One was his child with his maid Hagar (Gen. 16:3–4). Another was his son with Sarah (Gen. 21:1–3). The other six were born to Keturah, the woman he married after Sarah died (Gen. 25:1–6). But we don’t sing about “Father Abraham” because he gave birth to numerous sons. More importantly, he is our father in the faith.\r
\r
Today’s passage shows why Abraham deserves this title: not because of his parenting skills but because of his faith. Up until this point Abraham had relied on God to provide for his needs (see Gen. 14:21–24). But he was troubled\r
by his lack of an heir, despite God’s promise to make him a great nation (Gen. 12:2). The Lord reiterated His promise in a vision, and Abraham’s response was one of faith (vv. 5–6). Because of his faith, the Lord rewarded him with the gift of righteousness. In this way Abraham became the prototype of all who believe (see Rom. 4:3; Gal. 3:6; James 2:23).\r
\r
Abraham continued to struggle with doubt. His son by Hagar was the result of an attempt to bring about God’s promise through human effort. But in the end, he “was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised” (Rom. 4:20–21). God waited until Abraham and Sarah were too old to have children by any means other than divine intervention to show that the promise came from God.\r

In the matter of drudgery. Peter said in this passage that we have become “partakers of the divine nature” and that we should now be “giving all diligence,” concentrating on forming godly habits (2 Peter 1:4-5). We are to “add” to our lives all that character means. No one is born either naturally or supernaturally with character; it must be developed. Nor are we born with habits— we have to form godly habits on the basis of the new life God has placed within us. We are not meant to be seen as God’s perfect, bright-shining examples, but to be seen as the everyday essence of ordinary life exhibiting the miracle of His grace. Drudgery is the test of genuine character. The greatest hindrance to our spiritual life is that we will only look for big things to do. Yet, “Jesus…took a towel and…began to wash the disciples’ feet…” (John 13:3-5).\r
We all have those times when there are no flashes of light and no apparent thrill to life, where we experience nothing but the daily routine with its common everyday tasks. The routine of life is actually God’s way of saving us between our times of great inspiration which come from Him. Don’t always expect God to give you His thrilling moments, but learn to live in those common times of the drudgery of life by the power of God.\r
It is difficult for us to do the “adding” that Peter mentioned here. We say we do not expect God to take us to heaven on flowery beds of ease, and yet we act as if we do! I must realise that my obedience even in the smallest detail of life has all of the omnipotent power of the grace of God behind it. If I will do my duty, not for duty’s sake but because I believe God is engineering my circumstances, then at the very point of my obedience all of the magnificent grace of God is mine through the glorious atonement by the Cross of Christ.\r

In part, this strangeness is due to cultural differences and different customs— few of us are nomadic or live in vast, extended family tribes. But in addition, the strangeness of Abraham’s family is that God was using them as a kind of living parable, providing lessons in following God for future generations.\r
\r
Ishmael was the firstborn son of Abraham—but he was not the son God had promised. Perhaps he felt insecure as the son of Sarah’s servant, or he may have discerned that Abraham felt differently toward Isaac than he did toward Ishmael. Ishmael was likely aware that Isaac had a special place in God’s plan. For whatever reason— perhaps even just plain brotherly teasing—he mocked Isaac, and Sarah saw it and demanded that Abraham banish both Ishmael and Hagar from the household.\r
\r
Despite Abraham’s reluctance to cast out his son, God confirmed Sarah’s harsh sentence but also promised Abraham that He would care for Ishmael. God dealt compassionately with Hagar and Ishmael by providing for their needs and making Ishmael into a great nation. But it was Isaac who was the child of promise.\r
\r
In Galatians 4:28–30 Paul reveals the spiritual lesson in these events. The only way to become a child of God is by way of promise, not through human effort. We cannot become God’s children by trying to obey His commands or solve the problem of sin on our own terms. Righteousness only comes to us as a gift through faith. Like Abraham and Sarah, God must do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. Those who try to obtain righteousness by keeping the law are slaves to the law and to sin. The law cannot free us from sin.\r

Rounds not only saved his son’s life but also became the first African- American live transplant donor in the state of Wisconsin.\r
\r
Abraham was asked to make a different kind of sacrifice. God asked him literally to sacrifice his son Isaac. The demand must have seemed strange to Abraham. Isaac was the child through whom God had promised to make Abraham a father of many nations. Yet as far as we are told in Scripture, Abraham did not argue with God. The author of Hebrews tells us why: because of faith in God’s trustworthiness, not mindless obedience. Abraham believed that God was able to raise his son from the dead (Heb. 11:19). God never intended that Abraham would go through with the slaughter; instead, He wanted to make a point: “Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son” (Gen. 22:12).\r
\r
Is it possible to love God’s promises more than God Himself? We can be so distracted by the things God provides that we lose sight of God. When this happens, God may ask us to choose. The language God uses to describe Isaac reveals the importance of this test for Abraham. God calls him Abraham’s “only son” in verse 2. This was not technically true; as we have already seen, Abraham had another son by Sarah’s maid Hagar. But this designation underscored the uniqueness of Isaac both in Abraham’s affection and in God’s plan. Isaac was Abraham’s unique son. He was the child of promise."

What is the difference between grace and favoritism? The chief difference is that favoritism is based on some perceived advantage inherent in the one who is treated differently. It may be wealth, social status, or simply the fact that the one who is treated as a favorite is part of the same club. Grace is not bestowed on the basis of personal worth. Jacob did not deserve the primary place in God’s plan. Isaac and Rebekah demonstrated favoritism in their attitude toward their sons, preferring the child who shared their own interests. God does not show favoritism, but neither does He treat everyone the same. We are not all granted the same abilities, resources, or opportunities.

At the instigation of his mother, Jacob had disguised himself as his brother in order to steal the blessing that God had already promised to him, taking advantage of his father’s failing eyesight.\r

Isaac discovered the deceit when Esau came to him for the blessing he had already unwittingly bestowed on Jacob. Jacob’s behavior was deceitful, but Esau’s complaint about him was not entirely honest, either. Jacob did not take the birthright; Esau had carelessly sold it to him for a single meal (Gen. 25:29–34). Esau despised his birthright and showed contempt for God (Gen. 25:34; Heb. 12:16–17).\r

We can see the destructive power of parental favoritism at work in this story, but amazingly we also see God working in the midst of this dysfunctional family to accomplish His plan. He is not yet finished working with Jacob, the deceitful schemer. And despite Esau’s godless attitude, he did receive a genuine blessing. Isaac’s backhanded blessing concludes with the promise that Esau’s descendants would eventually throw off the yoke of subjugation.\r
\r
Old Testament commentator Derek Kidner describes Esau’s blessing as “the appropriate destiny of the ‘profane person’: the freedom to live unblessed and untamed.” John Calvin similarly noted that the “unbridled liberty of Esau was more wretched than any state of subjection.” For some who have scorned His promises and priorities, God’s worst judgment may be to grant us our heart’s desire."
"The trickster meets his match","Moody Global Ministries","""2016-06-09T17:10:43.869Z""","""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z""","In mythology, legend, and story, the trickster is a character who survives through lying or deceit. Tricksters often violate cultural norms and subvert those who are in power. Every culture has stories in which the trickster is a key player. Some scholars have seen elements of the trickster in Jacob. He was a man who survived by cunning and deceit. But in today’s text Jacob the Trickster meets his match—both in love and war.\r
\r
Today’s passage is a love story, describing how Jacob fell in love with Rachel but was tricked into marrying Leah by their father, Laban. Why would a father do such a thing to his daughter? Laban’s explanation was that it was not customary for the younger daughter to marry first. This was probably true, but Laban also had another motive. By deceiving the deceiver, Laban tricked Jacob into giving him fourteen years of service instead of seven.\r
\r
Family drama fills this account. Laban uses his own daughters to barter for Jacob’s services. Rachel is loved more than Leah. Yet once again we will see that God is working out His purposes in the midst of what most of us would call serious family dysfunction.\r
\r
As for Jacob, this turn of events was part of God’s long process of taming the trickster and turning him into a man of faith. Jacob’s trials were far from over. But by turning the tables on him, God had begun to wean Jacob away from a lifestyle of self-reliance. In time Jacob would learn that God’s promise comes by faith and not by human effort, schemes, or trickery. \r
\r
Jacob did not learn this lesson easily and neither do we. The overall nature of his life was one of struggle—with his brother, then with his father-in-law, and eventually with God Himself (see Gen. 32:28).\r

But in October 2015, China abandoned its policy of limiting families to one child. The one- child rule was implemented in the late 1970s in an effort to limit population growth. Parents who had a second child were fined and could even lose their jobs. The Chinese government made the recent change in the hope that it would help with China’s rapidly aging population and improve the gender balance.\r
\r
The battle between Jacob’s two wives reveals the opposite cultural value: a woman’s worth was based on her ability to have children. The inability to bear children was considered a mark of shame. In Jacob’s family, this shame was even more acute, and the tension between Rachel and Leah further aggravated by Jacob’s preference for Rachel. This resulted in what might be called “the battle of the babies.”\r
\r
Rachel and Leah vied with one another and even schemed to see who would have the most children. Some of their plots seem reminiscent of Abraham and Sarah’s attempt to force God’s hand through human effort. God had promised to use Jacob’s family line to fulfill the promise made to Abraham that he would be the father of nations. Both Leah and Rachel wanted to be the mother God used to keep that promise.\r
\r
God granted children to both, but not because of their schemes. His actions were motivated by compassion for the two women and in response to their prayers (Gen. 29:31; 30:6). Meanwhile Jacob seems like a hapless tool in all of this. He is passed back and forth between these women and their servants. His only comment is\r
an exasperated admission that the outcome rests in the hands of God (Gen. 30:2).\r

It is the Church that acts as the medium through which the miracles of God manifests to the world. Every individual in the Church of Jesus Christ has distinct functions. Many Christians today do not seem to be aware of the tremendous power they are endowed with once they become born again. Meanwhile, those who acknowledge, appreciate and use accordingly, the power given to them, experience miracles. Miracles from God cause the Church to grow. When there are genuine miracles, there is always an explosion of attendance, spiritual growth and commitment to the work of God. During one of our Holy Ghost services in Nigeria, the power of God was present and several miracles were happening around the altar. As a result, many people were standing up to catch a glimpse of what was responsible for the widespread excitement. There was a man in the congregation who was very short and could not see what was happening because others were taller and were blocking his view. Then with a strong desire, he whispered “Oh Lord, I wish I were taller”, and the Almighty God, who knows the voice of everyone, made him two inches taller. Ordinarily, this is not possible, but where God is involved, impossibilities became possible. This year, whatever looks impossible before you will receive the attention of Heaven in Jesus’ name.\r"

You cannot achieve your goals in life if you are not optimistic. When you are positive about the outcome of every situation, what the devil meant for evil will always turn out good for you. Every outstanding event in a man’s life will always be as a result of his expectation in God. \r"

This is the kind of life that Jesus Christ truly reflected. At a point in your Christian race, the life of Christ begins to replace your natural life and the abilities of God are made manifest in your endeavors. As a believer, people should look at you and prefer to serve the God you serve as a result of the undeniable proof that they can visibly see.\r
“Saying, what shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.”\r
Acts 4:16\r
During the time of Jesus’ earthly ministry, the people marveled at His manner of doctrine every time they had an opportunity to listen to Him at the synagogue. This is an example we should follow as children of God in our daily lives. People should be able to testify that the moment you gave your life to Christ, you become a supernatural being and the life of Christ was implanted in you.\r
There is the need to understand the potency of the power behind signs and wonders. The Name of Jesus is the only weapon that triggers wonders in the life of people. At the sight of His presence during the marriage at Cana in Galilee, they knew they could not be embarrassed. The Name of Jesus puts an end to all forms of harassment, lack and disgrace.

"Departing from the Lord"," morning star","""2016-06-09T17:10:43.869Z""","""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z""","And Cain said to the LORD, ""My punishment is too great to bear!\r
\r
""Behold, Thou hast driven me this day from the face of the ground; and from Thy face I shall be hidden, and I shall be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth, and it will come about that whoever finds me will kill me."" \r
\r
So the LORD said to him, ""Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold."" And the LORD appointed a sign for Cain, lest anyone finding him should slay him. \r
\r
Then Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden (Genesis 4:13-16).\r
\r
When the Lord told Cain how he could be delivered from depression he did not listen. When we do not heed the Lord, it will usually result in our falling even further into sin, just as it did with Cain. Cain still could have turned to the Lord, humbled himself, and repented, and he would have received help. The Lord warned him that he had to master the sin, but he continued down the path of letting his sin master him.\r
\r
It is interesting that, even then, Cain understood the law of sowing and reaping, which Paul explained in Galatians 6:7: ""Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap."" He knew that because he had murdered his brother, he was in danger of being murdered himself. This is a law that is as sure as the law of gravity. Therefore, if we want to receive grace, we should learn to sow grace every chance that we get. If we want to receive mercy, we should learn to sow mercy every chance we get. If we do good, we will reap good. If we do evil, we will reap the same.\r
\r
When reading about Cain's fear of being murdered, one might think, ""Who is going to murder him?"" Adam and Eve lived nearly one thousand years. They did begin to fulfil their commission to multiply and fill the earth, having many other sons and daughters. Obviously, there was already a population on the earth by the time Cain slew Abel. They were obviously close relatives to Cain, but he was still afraid of them. He had slain his own brother, so he knew that a brother could slay him. This was accurate enough, because all men ultimately derive their name from the same family, but that has never kept them from attacking one another.\r
\r
Even so, the Lord had mercy on Cain. He gave him a mark that would serve to protect him. Throughout the history of God's dealings with mankind, He has been quick to show unmerited grace and mercy to us. His grace and mercy is even enough for Him to negate the law of sowing and reaping. Throughout the Scriptures, we have many examples of the Lord causing crop failures from the evil seeds men have sown. However, we also have examples of swift judgement for those who have hardened their hearts and presumed upon His grace and mercy.\r
\r
The worst result of Cain's sin of murdering his brother was that he ""went out from the presence of the Lord."" When fighting occurs between brethren in churches, or between churches, this is often the ultimate result. Many will end up actually departing from the Lord. That is why from the very beginning, one of the enemy's primary strategies has been to get brothers to fight with each other. He is called ""the accuser of our brethren"" (see Revelation 12:10), because one of his most effective weapons against us is to get us accusing one another.\r
\r
Cain somehow thought that Abel was the reason for his rejection. The rejection of Cain's offering had nothing to do with Abel's offering. The answer to Cain's problem had nothing to do with Abel, but with himself. However, from the beginning, blaming someone else for our own problems has been one of the primary deceptions that has kept men from the grace of God. It has also led to the most destructive wars in history, and it has led to the most destructive wars between churches in history.\r
\r
First, the enemy will try to get us to be jealous of others. Then he will get us to accuse them of being the reason for our own problems. That is why nations that are having serious difficulties become so dangerous. It often seems much easier to blame someone else and attack them instead of dealing with our own problems. People will tend to rally around us if we can portray a common enemy that is causing our problems. Churches and people can become dangerous when they start having serious problems. If you see them starting to attack and blame others, it is time to depart. We must not continue to get caught in this trap of the enemy, which is the seemingly cheap escape from dealing with our own shortcomings. It will lead us to needlessly wounding others. Even worse than that, it will also lead us to ""departing from the presence of the Lord."

The Bible says, ‘Love never fails.’ Think about it: money doesn’t bring happiness, fame doesn’t bring self-worth, and revenge doesn’t bring satisfaction. The only thing that never fails is love. When Mother Teresa addressed world leaders at the United Nations, she was asked, ‘How can we have world peace?’ She replied, ‘Go home and love your family.’ If we all did that, ‘Paradise Lost’ would become ‘Paradise Found’! Napoleon Bonaparte’s intellectual greatness and intense egotism make his alleged tribute to the supremacy of leadership by love all the more striking. He said, ‘Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne and I myself founded great empires: but upon what did the creations of our genius depend? Upon force. Jesus alone founded His empire upon love, and to this day millions would die for Him.’ Sometimes leaders are just power-holders. Because you can’t love others without making yourself vulnerable, they see expressing love as a weakness. But the fact is you can’t love and ‘keep all your options open’. To truly love—whether it’s your spouse, your children, or the people you lead—you must give yourself unreservedly in such a way that you can be hurt and even rejected. The fundamental principle on which power-holders operate is to protect themselves and everything they have. Whereas the fundamental principle of true leadership is to give of yourself with no holds barred. Love as an intrinsic characteristic of leadership seems outmoded, yet according to Scripture it’s still the winning strategy. The Bible says, ‘God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.’ (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV) That’s why love is the winning strategy.\r

You are royalty. You have been made kings and priests unto God. The reason the devil runs roughshod over you is because you have refused to understand this fact and to behave like royalty. There are environments in which you can't find a worldly prince because he is royalty. There are ways in which he can't talk. There are movies he can't watch because he does not want his mind to be twisted. There is music he does not listen to. There are books he will not read. He lives his life by virtue of who he is. He lives his life conscious of the fact that he is royalty. Because he is born royalty, others will train him and guide him to live the life of royalty. He is uncommon, so he can't function like a common man.\r
 \r
The word 'common' means ordinary, inferior, lacking distinction, mean, low, lacking in rank, and not exceptional. Why would you function like a common man when God has elevated you? Ephesians 2:4-6 (KJV) says, ""But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) And hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus"".\r

Because the devil says, ""What do you mean, you are like me? What right do you have to tell me what to do? There is no difference between us. You live like me."" Child of God, you are royalty! So stop living life frivolously. Take responsibility for your life. You are the extension of God in your world. You are His righteousness. You are His beloved. Square up your shoulders, knowing who you are. It's your assignment. Understand that you are royalty and live like royalty.\r

 Am I fulfilling this ministry of intercession deep within the hidden recesses of my life? There is no trap nor any danger at all of being deceived or of showing pride in true intercession. It is a hidden ministry that brings forth fruit through which the Father is glorified. Am I allowing my spiritual life to waste away, or am I focused, bringing everything to one central point— the atonement of my Lord? Is Jesus Christ more and more dominating every interest of my life? If the central point, or the most powerful influence, of my life, is the atonement of the Lord, then every aspect of my life will bear fruit for Him.\r
However, I must take the time to realise what this central point of power is. Am I willing to give one minute out of every hour to concentrate on it? “If you abide in Me…”— that is if you continue to act, and think, and work from that central point— “you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you” (John 15:7). Am I abiding? Am I taking the time to abide? What is the greatest source of power in my life? Is it my work, service, and sacrifice for others, or is it my striving to work for God? It should be none of these— what ought to exert the greatest power in my life is the atonement of the Lord. It is not on what we spend the greatest amount of time that moulds us the most, but whatever exerts the most power over us. We must make a determination to limit and concentrate our desires and interests on the atonement by the Cross of Christ.\r
“Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do….” The disciple who abides in Jesus is the will of God, and what appears to be his free choices are actually God’s foreordained decrees. Is this mysterious? Does it appear to contradict sound logic or seem totally absurd? Yes, but what a glorious truth it is a saint of God.\r

The only way you can be on top of the world system as a believer is for you to make the decision to order your life based on the word of God. Otherwise, you will remain minced meat in the hands of the world system. Others are not going to change, but we have a power that can lift us up. We have things within us and available to us. We have a power that can silence the powers of darkness and cause us to take our portion.\r

God has called us and told us to come up higher. It is an invitation to you from God, telling you to grow up and that you can no longer remain a baby. I am calling all believers to rise up and be high-flyers. It is an invitation to leave the mundane and mediocrity. It is an invitation to shoot for excellence, to leave your footprints on the sands of time, to come up to a life of abundance and success, and to live a fulfilled life.\r

But the problem is that spiritual men and women want to live their lives in the flesh. ""For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace"" (Romans 8:6, KJV). To be carnally minded means that you are thinking like the rest of the world even though you are a spiritual person. As long as you want to dominate the material world in your flesh, you will never succeed, because there is a devil that is loosed on earth to hinder you. But God is saying that through His word He has given us exceedingly great and precious promises. And through these promises in the word, we can partake of His divine nature.\r
 \r
However, though you have a divine nature, which is the life of Christ in you, you can't partake of it until you begin to function in the promises. Come up to the higher ground today and function in the word.\r

But his delight and desire are in the law of the Lord, and on His law (the precepts, the instructions, the teachings of God) he habitually meditates (ponders and studies) by day and by night. And he shall be like a tree firmly planted [and tended] by the streams of water, ready to bring forth its fruit in its season; its leaf also shall not fade or wither, and everything he does shall prosper I and come to maturity].Psalm 1:2-3\r
Your word has I laid up in my heart, that I might not sin against You...I will meditate on Your precepts and have respect to Your ways [the paths of life marked out by Your law]. Psalm 119:11, 15\r
In the early days of computers, they used to say, ""Garbage in, garbage out."" That was a way of explaining that the computer only worked with the data put into the machine. If we wanted different results, we needed to put in different information.\r
When it comes to computers, most people have no trouble grasping that concept, but when it comes to their minds, they don't seem to get it. Or perhaps they don't want to get it. So many things demand their attention and beg for their focus. They're not just sinful things. The apostle Paul said that although everything was lawful for him, not everything was helpful (see l Corinthians 6:12).\r
If you are going to win the battle of the mind and defeat your enemy, where you focus your attention is crucial. The more you meditate on God's Word, the stronger you'll become and the more easily you'll win the victories.\r
Too many Christians don't realise the difference between meditating on the Bible and reading the Bible. They like to think that whenever they read God's Word, they're absorbing the deep things of God. Too often people will read a chapter of the Bible, and when they get to the last verse, they have little idea of what they've read. Those who meditate on Gods Word are those who think and think seriously about what they're reading.\r
They may not put it in these words, but they are saying, ""God, speak to me. Teach me. As I ponder Your Word, reveal its depth to me.""\r
In today’s scripture, I quoted from Psalm 1. This psalm begins by defining the person who is blessed and then points out the right actions of that person. The psalmist wrote that those who meditate and do it day and night are like productive trees...and everything they do shall prosper.\r
The psalmist made it quite clear that meditating on and thinking about God's Word brings results. As you ponder who God is and what He’s saying to you, you'll grow. It's really that simple. Another way to put it is to say that whatever you focus on, you become. If you read about and allow your mind to focus on God's love and power, that's what operates in you.\r
The apostle Paul says it beautifully in Philippians 4:8: ...""Whatever is true, whatever is worthy of reverence and is honorable and seemly, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely and lovable, whatever is kind and winsome and gracious, if there are any virtue and excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think on and weigh and take account of these things [fix your minds on them].""\r
It's sad, but most Christians don't put much effort into their study of the Word_ They go to hear others teach and preach, and they may listen to sermon tapes and read the Bible occasionally, but they're not dedicated to making God's Word a major part of their lives.\r
Be careful what you think about. The more you think about good things, the better your life will seem. The more you think about Jesus Christ and the principles He taught, the more you become like Jesus and the stronger you grow And as you grow, you win the battle for your mind.\r
Lord God, help me think about the things that honour` You. Fill my life with a hunger for more of You and Your Word so that in everything I may prosper. I ask this through Jesus Christ. Amen.\r"

\r
Ask if you have not received. There is nothing more difficult than asking. We will have yearnings and desires for certain things, and even suffer as a result of their going unfulfilled, but not until we are at the limit of desperation will we ask. It is the sense of not being spiritually real that causes us to ask. Have you ever asked out of the depths of your total insufficiency and poverty? “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God…” (James 1:5), but be sure that you do lack wisdom before you ask. You cannot bring yourself to the point of spiritual reality anytime you choose. The best thing to do, once you realise you are not spiritually real, is to ask God for the Holy Spirit, basing your request on the promise of Jesus Christ (see Luke 11:13). The Holy Spirit is the one who makes everything that Jesus did for you real in your life.\r
“Everyone who asks receives….” This does not mean that you will not get if you do not ask, but it means that until you come to the point of asking, you will not receive from God (seeMatthew 5:45). To be able to receive means that you have to come into the relationship of a child of God, and then you comprehend and appreciate mentally, morally, and with spiritual understanding, that these things come from God.\r
“If any of you lacks wisdom….” If you realise that you are lacking, it is because you have come in contact with spiritual reality— do not put the blinders of reason on again. The word asks actually means “beg.” Some people are poor enough to be interested in their poverty, and some of us are poor enough spiritually to show our interest. Yet we will never receive if we ask with a certain result in mind because we are asking out of our lust, not out of our poverty. A pauper does not ask out of any reason other than the completely hopeless and painful condition of his poverty. He is not ashamed to beg— blessed are the paupers in spirit (see Matthew 5:3).\r

He told a few Christians they had to live like the world, sharing all the same misfortune, defeat, poverty and failure as those around them. Well, the word spread. You may have heard the rumor yourself. But I am telling you right now that it is a crafty lie.\r
The Word of God says in Psalm 91:10, that evil can’t even come near your house if you are abiding in Him.\r
In John 16, Jesus Himself says He has deprived the world of power to harm you. And Exodus 10:23 says that when thick darkness surrounded the Egyptians, the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\r
By these and other scriptures, you can see that God never intended you to experience all of the junk that the world suffers. He’s always wanted His children to live above it, to stand out as light in a dark world.\r
In the Old Testament, God’s fame was established because of the miracles He had worked for His children. That same thing should be true today with you and me. We should be glorifying God by the miraculously victorious lives we live. People should be coming up to us and saying things like, “I’ve heard how God healed you.” Or, “I’ve heard how your children were delivered from drugs,” or, “God has really brought you out of a financial crisis.”\r
Can you see now why Satan would spread a rumor that would make you believe you have to suffer with the world instead of live as victor over it? He doesn’t want people running after you asking where you get your power, your peace, your health and prosperity.\r
But that’s exactly what God wants to happen. So, put the Word of God to work and dare to receive the blessings He has promised to you. Let the light of God’s power in your life put the devil’s dark rumors to rest!\r"

\r
Seek if you have not found. “You ask and do not receive because you ask amiss…” (James 4:3). If you ask for things from life instead of from God, “you ask amiss”; that is, you ask out of your desire for self-fulfillment. The more you fulfil yourself the less you will seek God. “…seek, and you will find….” Get to work— narrow your focus and interests to this one thing. Have you ever sought God with your whole heart, or have you simply given Him a feeble cry after some emotionally painful experience? “…seek, [focus,] and you will find….”\r
“Ho! Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters…” (Isaiah 55:1). Are you thirsty, or complacent and indifferent— so satisfied with your own experience that you want nothing more of God? Experience is a doorway, not a final goal. Beware of building your faith on experience, or your life will not ring true and will only sound the note of a critical spirit. Remember that you can never give another person what you have found, but you can cause him to have a desire for it.\r
“…knock, and it will be opened to you” (Luke 11:9). “Draw near to God…” (James 4:8). Knock— the door is closed, and your heartbeat races as you knock. “Cleanse your hands…” (James 4:8). Knock a bit louder— you begin to find that you are dirty. “…purify your hearts…” (James 4:8). It is becoming even more personal— you are desperate and serious now— you will do anything. “Lament…” (James 4:9). Have you ever lamented, expressing your sorrow before God for the condition of your inner life? There is no thread of self-pity left, only the heart-rending difficulty and amazement which comes from seeing what kind of person you really are. “Humble yourselves…” (James 4:10). It is a humbling experience to knock at God’s door— you have to knock with the crucified thief. “…to him who knocks it will be opened” (Luke 11:10).\r

That may sound odd to you, especially if you don’t have much of an interest in the Word right now. But, believe me, it’s possible. I’ve done it myself and I’ve seen others do it, time and again.\r
All you have to do is make a decision to give yourself to it. To focus your time and attention on it. The more you give yourself to it, the more your desire for it will grow. Eventually, it will consume your thinking.\r
Surprised? You shouldn’t be. That happens with anything you totally give yourself to. It happens, for example, with people who give themselves to pornography. As they focus their attention on it, the spirit behind it moves in on their consciousness and eventually draws them from mental activity into physical activity. Finally, they come to a place where they can’t be satisfied. They can’t get enough.\r
That same principle works on the positive side when you begin to give yourself to God’s Word. You can give yourself to it to the point where it totally consumes your mental and physical life. The more of it you get, the more you want. The Spirit behind the Word, the Holy Spirit, will draw you and lead you closer to Jesus than you ever imagined possible.\r
I’ve never yet met anyone walking in faith and power who at some time hadn’t developed that kind of addiction by giving themselves totally to the Word for an extended time. I don’t mean just a few minutes here and there either. I’m talking about some serious time.\r

Warnings are wrapped in the posers, which are themselves very profound truths designed to teach deep Kingdom and relational realities. Can two walk together if they are not spiritually compatible? Would a Holy God entertain companionship with carnal man? No. The carnal man must first abandon his sinful way. If the Lion of the tribe of Judah should roar against sin, would the sinner not tremble and fear? And if the battle trumpet be blown, would there not be a flight for safety? Notwithstanding, there is God's assurance that even in anger He is merciful. What God is telling us is that He will always use His servants to issue warnings before moving in with judgments if the need arises. Can man then murmur when swift divine judgment follows the refusal to repent? We are the architect of the evil that accompanies sin, not God. The instructive takeaway of the lesson today is that the sinner and backslider as well as the careless Christian should not handle God's warning about the wrath to come with levity. God's admonitions are the Father's unique way of showing mercy to us. It is also a clarion call to the believer not to fall for the erroneous teaching of eternal security which assumes that a saved person can live a care-free life without watching against the possibility of backsliding. God's precepts are for all and sundry. Proverb 14:16 says it all: ""A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.""\r

It is perhaps the most destructive and the most widely accepted misinterpretation of Scripture that exists in the Body of Christ today. I’ve gone into countries to preach to people who hardly had any knowledge of the Word at all and still I have found that somehow they’d been taught about Paul’s thorn.\r
And most of them have been taught wrongly.\r
Tradition says that God gave Paul the thorn in the flesh. What’s more, tradition makes the “thorn” into some great mystery. But the Scripture doesn’t say that at all!\r
It says that the thorn in the flesh was a messenger of Satan. Not God—Satan! The thorn was quite literally just what Paul says it was—a “messenger sent from Satan.”\r
You see, everywhere Paul went, he preached the gospel and every time he preached, he destroyed a little more of Satan’s kingdom. So, Satan sent a messenger, an evil spirit, to stop him.\r
When Paul sought the Lord concerning this thorn (look at 2 Corinthians 12:8-10), God didn’t answer Paul in the negative. God said, “My grace (or, My favor) is enough. It is sufficient for you. For My strength is made perfect in your weakness (inability to produce results)” (W.E. Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words).\r
In other words, when Paul didn’t have enough human strength to overcome, God’s miracle-working power was sufficient for him. It enabled him to be an overcomer in spite of his weakness.\r
Don’t allow the devil to talk you out of your victory. Throw tradition aside and dare to believe the Word of God. Fight the fight of faith, and just like the Apostle Paul, you will see the salvation of the Lord!\r

If you’ve made Jesus Christ the Lord of your life, you’ve already taken the first step of obedience. The love of God has been born within you. But, unless you take steps to develop it, that love will remain hidden within you. Love works in much the same way as the force of faith. Like faith, love becomes active through knowledge of the Word.\r

We end up spending so much time and energy taking care of the legitimate “things” of life that we unconsciously give the attention and affections of our heart over to this natural world instead of to God.\r
When Kenneth and I first heard about living by faith, we were in desperate circumstances. We were sick and broke, so it was easy for us to dedicate ourselves to prayer and to the Word. But as we honored God’s Word, He honored and prospered us. We came to the place where we were no longer desperate. Then came the real test of our faith. Would we serve God out of our love for Him instead of our desperation?\r
Well, praise God, we did. But in the process we found out one thing: It takes a lot more dedication to serve God when you’re prosperous than it takes when you’re desperate! There’s a constant temptation to get so caught up in the earthly things that your desire for the things of God fades into the background.\r
As the material blessings of God come your way, remember, God has not trained you in His Word so you can consume it on your own lusts. He has revealed His Word to you so you can walk in the spirit and do the job He’s called you to do.\r

Where sin and sorrow stops, and the song of the saint starts. Do I really want to get there? I can right now. The questions that truly matter in life are remarkably few, and they are all answered by these words— “Come to Me.” Our Lord’s words are not, “Do this, or don’t do that,” but— “Come to me.” If I will simply come to Jesus, my real life will be brought into harmony with my real desires. I will actually cease from sin, and will find the song of the Lord beginning in my life.\r
Have you ever come to Jesus? Look at the stubbornness of your heart. You would rather do anything than this one simple childlike thing— “Come to Me.” If you really want to experience ceasing from sin, you must come to Jesus.\r

At the most unexpected moments in your life there is this whisper of the Lord— “Come to Me,” and you are immediately drawn to Him. Personal contact with Jesus changes everything. Be “foolish” enough to come and commit yourself to what He says. The attitude necessary for you to come to Him is one where your will has made the determination to let go of everything and deliberately commit it all to Him.\r
“…and I will give you rest”— that is, “I will sustain you, causing you to stand firm.” He is not saying, “I will put you to bed, hold your hand, and sing you to sleep.” But, in essence, He is saying, “I will get you out of bed— out of your listlessness and exhaustion, and out of your condition of being half dead while you are still alive.

But most of us don’t come by that attitude easily. We’re so accustomed to losing that we have to totally change our way of thinking if we want to have a winning mind-set. In Ephesians, the Apostle Paul told the Church to renew their minds. Like us, they needed to change their attitudes, to renew their minds to the fact that Jesus overcame the world.\r

Yet there is no circumstance of life in which we cannot abide in Jesus.\r
“You are Simon….You shall be called Cephas” (John 1:42). God writes our new name only on those places in our lives where He has erased our pride, self-sufficiency, and self-interest.

When we are in our best spiritual mood, you would think we were the highest quality saints. But don’t dare look at us when we are not in that mood.

It is either that you do not want to be a saint, or that you do not believe that God can make you into one. You say it would be all right if God saved you and took you straight to heaven. That is exactly what He will do! And not only do we make our home with Him, but Jesus said of His Father and Himself, “…We will come to him and make Our home with him” (John 14:23). Put no conditions on your life— let Jesus be everything to you, and He will take you home with Him not only for a day but for eternity.\r

Where our individual desire dies and sanctified surrender lives. One of the greatest hindrances in coming to Jesus is the excuse of our own individual temperament. We make our temperament and our natural desires barriers to coming to Jesus. Yet the first thing we realise when we do come to Jesus is that He pays no attention whatsoever to our natural desires. We have the idea that we can dedicate our gifts to God. However, you cannot dedicate what is not yours. There is actually only one thing you can dedicate to God, and that is your right to yourself (see Romans 12:1). If you will give God your right to yourself, He will make a holy experiment out of you— and His experiments always succeed. The one true mark of a saint of God is the inner creativity that flows from being totally surrendered to Jesus Christ. In the life of a saint, there is this amazing Well, which is a continual Source of original life. The Spirit of God is a Well of water springing up perpetually fresh. A saint realises that it is God who engineers his circumstances; consequently, there are no complaints, only unrestrained surrender to Jesus. Never try to make your experience a principle for others, but allow God to be as creative and original with others as He is with you.\r
If you abandon everything to Jesus and come when He says, “Come,” then He will continue to say, “Come,” through you. You will go out into the world reproducing the echo of Christ’s “Come.” That is the result in every soul who has abandoned all and come to Jesus.\r

 In the matter of determination. The Spirit of Jesus is put into me by way of the atonement by the Cross of Christ. I then have to build my thinking patiently to bring it into perfect harmony with my Lord. God will not make me think like Jesus— I have to do it myself. I have to bring “every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:5). “Abide in Me”— in intellectual matters, in money matters, in every one of the matters that make human life what it is. Our lives are not made up of only one neatly confined area.\r
Am I preventing God from doing things in my circumstances by saying that it will only serve to hinder my fellowship with Him? How irrelevant and disrespectful that is! It does not matter what my circumstances are. I can be as much assured of abiding in Jesus in any one of them as I am in any prayer meeting. It is unnecessary to change and arrange my circumstances myself. Our Lord’s inner abiding was pure and unblemished. He was at home with God wherever His body was. He never chose His own circumstances, but was meek, submitting to His Father’s plans and directions for Him. Just think of how amazingly relaxed our Lord’s life was! But we tend to keep God at a fever pitch in our lives. We have none of the serenity of the life which is “hidden with Christ in God” (Colossians 3:3).\r
Think of the things that take you out of the position of abiding in Christ. You say, “Yes, Lord, just a minute— I still have this to do. Yes, I will abide as soon as this is finished, or as soon as this week is over. It will be all right, Lord. I will abide then.” Get moving— begin to abide now. In the initial stages it will be a continual effort to abide, but as you continue, it will become so much a part of your life that you will abide in Him without any conscious effort. Make the determination to abide in Jesus wherever you are now or wherever you may be placed in the future.\r

It depends on how many you expect to receive. When God measures them out to you, He’ll be using your measuring stick, not His own. He always works that way.\r
Two people can hear God’s Word about healing, for example. One will measure it with faith. “Praise God, by His stripes I was healed!” he’ll say. “I believe that with all my heart, and I’m going to keep on believing it until I receive my healing.”\r
The other will measure it with skepticism. “I don’t care what Bible verses he comes up with,” he’ll say. “I just don’t trust that preacher. I’ll give this healing stuff a try, but I doubt very much if anything’s going to come of it.”\r
Both of those people will get exactly what they expect. God will measure to them just as they measured the Word. One will get healed...the other won’t.\r
I must warn you though, sometimes measuring the Word with faith is hard. Years ago, when Gloria first read the scripture, “Owe no man anything,” it was tempting for her to measure it as a curse, not a blessing. We were living in a terrible little house at the time, and she wanted a new one more than just about anything.\r
How were we ever going to buy a decent house without borrowing? It didn’t seem possible. So, to her, it was as if that scripture had said, “Gloria, you can’t have a new house.”\r
But she refused to measure it that way. She grabbed the devil by the throat and said, “Look here now, you’re not going to cheat me out of my house.” Then she started believing that somehow God could provide her with a house debt free. Sure enough, He did.\r
If you want to receive blessings by the bushel load, start going to the Word with a bushel basket. Put a big measure of faith in the hand of God. He’ll fill it to overflowing and give it right back to you!\r

When God gives you a vision for your life, it’ll burn within you like a fire that can’t be extinguished. The psalmist said, ‘My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned.’ So, what are you passionate about? What burns ‘hot’ within you? When God calls you to do something, He creates within you both the desire to do it and the power to carry it out. Though you feel inadequate and unqualified, stand on His Word: ‘For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him’ (Philippians 2:13 NLT). Mahatma Gandhi had a vision of a free and independent India at a time when it was governed by the British. Henry Ford had a vision of every family in America owning the automobile at a time when people were frightened of his new invention. Daniel K. Ludwig had a vision of a self-supporting industrial region in the heart of the Brazilian jungle at a time when there was no industry, no electricity, and no city of any kind for hundreds of miles. Where do such creative desires come from? God, Who is our Creator! And when God gives you a true worldview, you’ll never be happy living in a narrow mental framework. Are there times when you’ll feel afraid and uncertain about what to do? Yes! Fear and faith are two sides of the same coin, and they’ll always be part of your thinking.

1 Corinthians 13:8\r
The Bible says, ‘Love never fails.’ Think about it: money doesn’t bring happiness, fame doesn’t bring self-worth, and revenge doesn’t bring satisfaction. The only thing that never fails is love. When Mother Teresa addressed world leaders at the United Nations, she was asked, ‘How can we have world peace?’ She replied, ‘Go home and love your family.’ If we all did that, ‘Paradise Lost’ would become ‘Paradise Found’! Napoleon Bonaparte’s intellectual greatness and intense egotism make his alleged tribute to the supremacy of leadership by love, all the more striking. He said, ‘Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, and I myself founded great empires: but upon what did the creations of our genius depend on ? Upon force. Jesus alone founded His empire upon love, and to this day millions would die for Him.’ Sometimes leaders are just power-holders. Because you can’t love others without making yourself vulnerable, they see expressing love as a weakness. But the fact is you can’t love and ‘keep all your options open’. To truly love - whether it’s your spouse, your children, or the people you lead - you must give yourself unreservedly in such a way that you can be hurt and even rejected. The fundamental principle on which power-holders operate is to protect themselves and everything they have. Whereas the fundamental principle of true leadership is to give of yourself with no holds barred. Love as an intrinsic characteristic of leadership seems outmoded, yet according to Scripture, it’s still the winning strategy. The Bible says, ‘God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind’ (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV). That’s why love is the winning strategy.\r

The love talked about in Scripture isn’t a sentimental emotion that gives you goose bumps. It’s compassion, caring, and concern for the well-being of another. It’s based on commitment, not convenience. It’s an act of your will, not a reflex of your emotions. Jesus asks a question that makes you stop in your tracks. ‘If you love only those who love you, why should you get credit for that? Even sinners love those who love them! And if you do good only to those who do good to you, why should you get credit?’ (vs. 32-33 NLT). Loving is the hardest thing you’ll ever do, and it will require all the grace God can give you. Jesus continues: ‘Love your enemies! Do good to them! Lend to them without expecting to be repaid. Then your reward from heaven will be very great, and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High, for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked. You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate. Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn others, or it will all come back to you. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven. Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full - pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over … The amount you give will determine the amount you get back’ (vv. 35-38 NLT).

One day Christ’s critics asked Him, ‘Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ (v. 36 NIV 2011 Edition). His answer is a timely reminder to both leaders and followers; it includes those who sit in the pews and those who stand in the pulpit. ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart … all your soul and all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment’ (vv. 37-38 NIV 2011 Edition). As a leader you must never leave a question in anyone’s mind as to who is God - and who isn’t. Namely, yourself! God said, ‘You shall have no other gods before Me’ (Exodus 20:3 NKJV). And that’s important because you’re never in greater danger than when people begin to praise you. Yes, we must teach people to respect, honour, and reward good leadership, but the Christlike leader discourages adulation and shies away from the limelight. John the Baptist was so successful as a preacher that when he finished speaking, his audience flocked to Jesus. Speaking of it, Christ later said, in essence, ‘John, you did your job well!’ Apparently John agreed, for he said, ‘He must increase, but I must decrease’ (John 3:30 NKJV). Isaiah wrote, ‘In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up’ (Isaiah 6:1 NKJV). The king had to die before Isaiah saw the Lord. Only when a leader becomes impervious to applause and approval and dies to ego, is God glorified in his or her leadership. Indeed, when Christ alone is exalted, the God-called leader smiles and says, ‘Thank You, Lord - that’s how You intended it.’\r

It’s okay to grow up in poverty, as long as poverty doesn’t grow up on you and control your thinking. One celebrity was asked how he felt about growing up in poverty. Amazingly, he confessed that he still suffered anxiety over having enough in the future. So he tended to be overly frugal, viewed his money as somewhat surreal, and wasn’t able to relax and enjoy the blessings that come with success.

As long as you are, you’ll remain vulnerable to people, circumstances, and economic conditions. But when you know God’s responsible for your success, what you gain you can maintain.

\r
Why does the Bible compare us to sheep? Because they’re one of the most dependent creatures in the world; they must trust in the shepherd for everything they need. And that’s how God wants you to live: in dependence on Him. When you constantly live in the fear of lack, you’re not trusting God enough. This core fear drives many of our other fears, including the fear of becoming disabled, or the fear of ageing, or the fear of investing, or the fear of retiring poor. In its extreme form, fear of lack can lead to anxiety that requires you to live on antidepressants or other medication. It’s also one of the root causes of greed. You can become so obsessed with insuring yourself against the possibility of not having enough, that you hoard more than you’ll ever need. It can drive you to become a workaholic so that neither you nor your children will ever experience discomfort, inconvenience, and helplessness. And like all fears, it’s based on an erroneous belief about God - in particular, His ability and willingness to take care of you. ‘The Lord is my Shepherd [to feed, guide, and shield me], I shall not lack.’ Stop living as though you don’t believe what God has promised you! A good strategy is to learn the promises, understand the ones that are conditional, meet the conditions, and rest in His love and faithfulness. This doesn’t mean you sit idly by and wait for God to do what He has given you the ability to do. You must do the natural things, and trust Him for the supernatural ones.\r

Here are some scriptural strategies for conquering your fear of lack: 1) Give God the first tenth of your income (see Malachi 3:8-12; Matthew 23:23). Don’t debate whether it’s an Old Testament rule versus a New Testament requirement. Wouldn’t you rather do more than required, then find out later that you fell short of God’s expectations? 2) Live by the 10-10-80 rule. After you give God the first 10 percent of your income, put the second 10 percent into savings and budget yourself to live on the remaining 80 percent. 3) Confront the areas in which your fear of lack is the greatest. Food? Housing? Transportation? Health insurance? Retirement? Now cast down those imaginations and replace them with this promise: ‘God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others’ (2 Corinthians 9:8 NLT). 4) Refuse to rely solely on your credentials, marketable skills, or influential contacts for the assurance of your financial provision. ‘Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us.’ Maximise your personal power, but trust ultimately in God’s power alone. Jesus said, ‘I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full’ (John 10:10 NIV 2011 Edition). That’s not just ‘spiritual’ life, but every aspect of life.

Here are some pointers to help you solve your relationship difficulties: 1) When it’s about money. How you manage money within a marriage depends on the set of skills you’ve developed and the amount of discipline you’ve exercised. One of you may be a saver and the other a spender. So you have to work together to make joint decisions that affect both of you, and work within the boundaries of your reality together. Consider how much debt you have, how much income, and how much you need to save. Find a way to achieve financial freedom. The Bible says, ‘The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is a servant to the lender’ (Proverbs 22:7 NKJV). 2) When it’s about time. If you’re not spending time together - one of you is missing the other. Ideally, you both want to spend more time together. But if your partner keeps making this complaint, take it as a compliment that he or she still enjoys your company. Schedule designated times together on both your calendars - with no intrusions. There’s no substitute for spending time with your mate. 3) When it’s about jealousy. We’re not talking about a possessive spouse who won’t allow you to glance at the waiter without accusing you of cheating. But generally, when there’s jealousy in a relationship it’s an indication of insecurity. You may need to have a frank discussion about your commitment to each other. Talk about the little habits and mannerisms your spouse interprets as flirtatious. Communicate, and don’t allow the jealousy to grow into bitterness, distrust, or disgust.\r

The list includes the names of individuals along with some of their accomplishments, including some of the greatest cities in biblical history.\r
\r
The purpose of the list is to set the stage for the destruction of the Tower of Babel. The overall impression is one of proliferation and growing ambition. In the next chapter this will culminate in an arrogant attempt to supplant God Himself.\r
\r
Instead of multiplying and filling the earth as they had been commanded (see Gen. 9:1, 7), the men of Babel chose to build a monument to themselves in the form of a city with a tower that reached to the heavens (Gen. 11:4). The function of this tower does not appear to have been for the purpose of worshiping God or even astrological deities. Instead, it was part of their project of self-worship. They were more intent on making a name for themselves than they were on glorifying God’s name. God thwarted their plan by destroying their tower, confusing their language, and scattering the people. This judgment was also a blessing, for it halted their rebellion.\r
\r
This curse was reversed on the day of Pentecost—not by restoring everyone to a single language, but by allowing everyone to declare the wonders of God in the langue of “every nation under heaven” (Acts 2:5).

But we don’t sing about “Father Abraham” because he gave birth to numerous sons. More importantly, he is our father in the faith.\r
\r
Today’s passage shows why Abraham deserves this title: not because of his parenting skills but because of his faith. Up until this point Abraham had relied on God to provide for his needs (see Gen. 14:21–24). But he was troubled\r
by his lack of an heir, despite God’s promise to make him a great nation (Gen. 12:2). The Lord reiterated His promise in a vision, and Abraham’s response was one of faith (vv. 5–6). Because of his faith, the Lord rewarded him with the gift of righteousness. In this way Abraham became the prototype of all who believe (see Rom. 4:3; Gal. 3:6; James 2:23).\r
\r
Abraham continued to struggle with doubt. His son by Hagar was the result of an attempt to bring about God’s promise through human effort. But in the end, he “was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised” (Rom. 4:20–21). God waited until Abraham and Sarah were too old to have children by any means other than divine intervention to show that the promise came from God.\r
\r
We are Abraham’s children if we believe God’s promise to give us the gift of righteousness through Jesus Christ (Gal. 3:7).\r

\r
In the matter of drudgery. Peter said in this passage that we have become “partakers of the divine nature” and that we should now be “giving all diligence,” concentrating on forming godly habits (2 Peter 1:4-5). We are to “add” to our lives all that character means. No one is born either naturally or supernaturally with character; it must be developed. Nor are we born with habits— we have to form godly habits on the basis of the new life God has placed within us. We are not meant to be seen as God’s perfect, bright-shining examples, but to be seen as the everyday essence of ordinary life exhibiting the miracle of His grace. Drudgery is the test of genuine character. The greatest hindrance to our spiritual life is that we will only look for big things to do. Yet, “Jesus…took a towel and…began to wash the disciples’ feet…” (John 13:3-5).\r
We all have those times when there are no flashes of light and no apparent thrill to life, where we experience nothing but the daily routine with its common everyday tasks. The routine of life is actually God’s way of saving us between our times of great inspiration which come from Him. Don’t always expect God to give you His thrilling moments, but learn to live in those common times of the drudgery of life by the power of God.\r
It is difficult for us to do the “adding” that Peter mentioned here. We say we do not expect God to take us to heaven on flowery beds of ease, and yet we act as if we do! I must realise that my obedience even in the smallest detail of life has all of the omnipotent power of the grace of God behind it. If I will do my duty, not for duty’s sake but because I believe God is engineering my circumstances, then at the very point of my obedience all of the magnificent grace of God is mine through the glorious atonement by the Cross of Christ.\r

"Two sons and one promise","Moody Global Ministries","""2016-06-09T17:10:43.875Z""","""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z""","Abraham’s family life seems strange to most modern readers. In part, this strangeness is due to cultural differences and different customs— few of us are nomadic or live in vast, extended family tribes. But in addition, the strangeness of Abraham’s family is that God was using them as a kind of living parable, providing lessons in following God for future generations.\r
\r
Ishmael was the firstborn son of Abraham—but he was not the son God had promised. Perhaps he felt insecure as the son of Sarah’s servant, or he may have discerned that Abraham felt differently toward Isaac than he did toward Ishmael. Ishmael was likely aware that Isaac had a special place in God’s plan. For whatever reason— perhaps even just plain brotherly teasing—he mocked Isaac, and Sarah saw it and demanded that Abraham banish both Ishmael and Hagar from the household.\r
\r
Despite Abraham’s reluctance to cast out his son, God confirmed Sarah’s harsh sentence but also promised Abraham that He would care for Ishmael. God dealt compassionately with Hagar and Ishmael by providing for their needs and making Ishmael into a great nation. But it was Isaac who was the child of promise.\r
\r
In Galatians 4:28–30 Paul reveals the spiritual lesson in these events. The only way to become a child of God is by way of promise, not through human effort. We cannot become God’s children by trying to obey His commands or solve the problem of sin on our own terms. Righteousness only comes to us as a gift through faith. Like Abraham and Sarah, God must do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. Those who try to obtain righteousness by keeping the law are slaves to the law and to sin. The law cannot free us from sin.\r

"A Father's Sacrifice","Moody Global Ministries","""2016-06-09T17:10:43.875Z""","""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"""," Many parents make sacrifices for their children, but Milwaukee father Eulos Rounds Sr. went beyond what most parents have to do. When his son was diagnosed with liver disease, Rounds volunteered to donate 30 percent of his liver. Rounds not only saved his son’s life but also became the first African- American live transplant donor in the state of Wisconsin.\r
\r
Abraham was asked to make a different kind of sacrifice. God asked him literally to sacrifice his son Isaac. The demand must have seemed strange to Abraham. Isaac was the child through whom God had promised to make Abraham a father of many nations. Yet as far as we are told in Scripture, Abraham did not argue with God. The author of Hebrews tells us why: because of faith in God’s trustworthiness, not mindless obedience. Abraham believed that God was able to raise his son from the dead (Heb. 11:19). God never intended that Abraham would go through with the slaughter; instead, He wanted to make a point: “Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son” (Gen. 22:12).\r
\r
Is it possible to love God’s promises more than God Himself? We can be so distracted by the things God provides that we lose sight of God. When this happens, God may ask us to choose. The language God uses to describe Isaac reveals the importance of this test for Abraham. God calls him Abraham’s “only son” in verse 2. This was not technically true; as we have already seen, Abraham had another son by Sarah’s maid Hagar. But this designation underscored the uniqueness of Isaac both in Abraham’s affection and in God’s plan. Isaac was Abraham’s unique son. He was the child of promise."
"Grace and Favoritism","Moody Global Ministries","""2016-06-09T17:10:43.875Z""","""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z""","In his book Everybody’s Normal Till You Get to Know Them, John Ortberg writes about the tendency we have to exclude other people. He uses the example of the different ways an airline will treat the people in first class compared\r
to those in coach: “The first-class passengers were served gourmet food on china and crystal by their own flight attendants; those of us in coach ate snacks served in paper bags with plastic wrappers,” Ortberg writes. “The first- class passengers had room to stretch and sleep; those of us in coach were sitting with a proximity usually reserved for engaged couples in the back row of a movie.” Preferential treatment is a common feature of human behavior.\r
\r
What about God? In today’s passage we learn that God’s plan for Jacob differed from His plan for Esau. Both would become the father of a nation, but the younger brother was to have supremacy. This plan violated cultural norms. In Isaac’s day, the right of inheritance was reserved for the firstborn.\r
\r
What is the difference between grace and favoritism? The chief difference is that favoritism is based on some perceived advantage inherent in the one who is treated differently. It may be wealth, social status, or simply the fact that the one who is treated as a favorite is part of the same club. Grace is not bestowed on the basis of personal worth. Jacob did not deserve the primary place in God’s plan. Isaac and Rebekah demonstrated favoritism in their attitude toward their sons, preferring the child who shared their own interests. God does not show favoritism, but neither does He treat everyone the same. We are not all granted the same abilities, resources, or opportunities. God showed grace in His promise to Jacob, who had done nothing to deserve it, because of His own plans for His people."
"Isaac's Backhanded Blessing","Moody Global Ministries","""2016-06-09T17:10:43.875Z""","""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z""","A backhanded compliment is often an insult masquerading as a compliment. In today’s passage we have an example of a backhanded blessing. Isaac blessed Esau as requested—but not with the blessing that Esau wanted. The blessing came after Isaac had given Jacob the blessing originally intended for Esau, the firstborn. At the instigation of his mother, Jacob had disguised himself as his brother in order to steal the blessing that God had already promised to him, taking advantage of his father’s failing eyesight.\r
\r
Isaac discovered the deceit when Esau came to him for the blessing he had already unwittingly bestowed on Jacob. Jacob’s behavior was deceitful, but Esau’s complaint about him was not entirely honest, either. Jacob did not take the birthright; Esau had carelessly sold it to him for a single meal (Gen. 25:29–34). Esau despised his birthright and showed contempt for God (Gen. 25:34; Heb. 12:16–17).\r
\r
We can see the destructive power of parental favoritism at work in this story, but amazingly we also see God working in the midst of this dysfunctional family to accomplish His plan. He is not yet finished working with Jacob, the deceitful schemer. And despite Esau’s godless attitude, he did receive a genuine blessing. Isaac’s backhanded blessing concludes with the promise that Esau’s descendants would eventually throw off the yoke of subjugation.\r
\r
Old Testament commentator Derek Kidner describes Esau’s blessing as “the appropriate destiny of the ‘profane person’: the freedom to live unblessed and untamed.” John Calvin similarly noted that the “unbridled liberty of Esau was more wretched than any state of subjection.” For some who have scorned His promises and priorities, God’s worst judgment may be to grant us our heart’s desire."
"The trickster meets his match","Moody Global Ministries","""2016-06-09T17:10:43.876Z""","""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z""","In mythology, legend, and story, the trickster is a character who survives through lying or deceit. Tricksters often violate cultural norms and subvert those who are in power. Every culture has stories in which the trickster is a key player. Some scholars have seen elements of the trickster in Jacob. He was a man who survived by cunning and deceit. But in today’s text Jacob the Trickster meets his match—both in love and war.\r
\r
Today’s passage is a love story, describing how Jacob fell in love with Rachel but was tricked into marrying Leah by their father, Laban. Why would a father do such a thing to his daughter? Laban’s explanation was that it was not customary for the younger daughter to marry first. This was probably true, but Laban also had another motive. By deceiving the deceiver, Laban tricked Jacob into giving him fourteen years of service instead of seven.\r
\r
Family drama fills this account. Laban uses his own daughters to barter for Jacob’s services. Rachel is loved more than Leah. Yet once again we will see that God is working out His purposes in the midst of what most of us would call serious family dysfunction.\r
\r
As for Jacob, this turn of events was part of God’s long process of taming the trickster and turning him into a man of faith. Jacob’s trials were far from over. But by turning the tables on him, God had begun to wean Jacob away from a lifestyle of self-reliance. In time Jacob would learn that God’s promise comes by faith and not by human effort, schemes, or trickery. \r
\r
Jacob did not learn this lesson easily and neither do we. The overall nature of his life was one of struggle—with his brother, then with his father-in-law, and eventually with God Himself (see Gen. 32:28).\r

"The battle for the babies: Part1","Moody Global Ministries","""2016-06-09T17:10:43.876Z""","""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z""","For years, China prioritized women’s value as workers and supporters of the state, not as mothers. But in October 2015, China abandoned its policy of limiting families to one child. The one- child rule was implemented in the late 1970s in an effort to limit population growth. Parents who had a second child were fined and could even lose their jobs. The Chinese government made the recent change in the hope that it would help with China’s rapidly aging population and improve the gender balance.\r
\r
The battle between Jacob’s two wives reveals the opposite cultural value: a woman’s worth was based on her ability to have children. The inability to bear children was considered a mark of shame. In Jacob’s family, this shame was even more acute, and the tension between Rachel and Leah further aggravated by Jacob’s preference for Rachel. This resulted in what might be called “the battle of the babies.”\r
\r
Rachel and Leah vied with one another and even schemed to see who would have the most children. Some of their plots seem reminiscent of Abraham and Sarah’s attempt to force God’s hand through human effort. God had promised to use Jacob’s family line to fulfill the promise made to Abraham that he would be the father of nations. Both Leah and Rachel wanted to be the mother God used to keep that promise.\r
\r
God granted children to both, but not because of their schemes. His actions were motivated by compassion for the two women and in response to their prayers (Gen. 29:31; 30:6). Meanwhile Jacob seems like a hapless tool in all of this. He is passed back and forth between these women and their servants. His only comment is\r
an exasperated admission that the outcome rests in the hands of God (Gen. 30:2).\r

It is the Church that acts as the medium through which the miracles of God manifests to the world. Every individual in the Church of Jesus Christ has distinct functions. Many Christians today do not seem to be aware of the tremendous power they are endowed with once they become born again. Meanwhile, those who acknowledge, appreciate and use accordingly, the power given to them, experience miracles. Miracles from God cause the Church to grow. When there are genuine miracles, there is always an explosion of attendance, spiritual growth and commitment to the work of God. During one of our Holy Ghost services in Nigeria, the power of God was present and several miracles were happening around the altar. As a result, many people were standing up to catch a glimpse of what was responsible for the widespread excitement. There was a man in the congregation who was very short and could not see what was happening because others were taller and were blocking his view. Then with a strong desire, he whispered “Oh Lord, I wish I were taller”, and the Almighty God, who knows the voice of everyone, made him two inches taller. Ordinarily, this is not possible, but where God is involved, impossibilities became possible. This year, whatever looks impossible before you will receive the attention of Heaven in Jesus’ name.\r"

To be positive is an expression of our confidence in the Almighty God and His Word. Hence, a positive expectation is an act motivated by the Word of God, it is proof that all will be well, an evidence that you are bigger than all your problems and circumstances, an assurance that today’s situation does not determine tomorrow’s glory, and that as long as you are connected to Jesus, all your stories will turn out to be great testimonies. You cannot achieve your goals in life if you are not optimistic. When you are positive about the outcome of every situation, what the devil meant for evil will always turn out good for you. Every outstanding event in a man’s life will always be as a result of his expectation in God. \r"
"Activating wonders 1","Open Heaven","""2016-06-09T17:10:43.876Z""","""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z""","There is no better life than a life that is full of wonders. This is the kind of life that Jesus Christ truly reflected. At a point in your Christian race, the life of Christ begins to replace your natural life and the abilities of God are made manifest in your endeavors. As a believer, people should look at you and prefer to serve the God you serve as a result of the undeniable proof that they can visibly see.\r
“Saying, what shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.”\r
Acts 4:16\r
During the time of Jesus’ earthly ministry, the people marveled at His manner of doctrine every time they had an opportunity to listen to Him at the synagogue. This is an example we should follow as children of God in our daily lives. People should be able to testify that the moment you gave your life to Christ, you become a supernatural being and the life of Christ was implanted in you.\r
There is the need to understand the potency of the power behind signs and wonders. The Name of Jesus is the only weapon that triggers wonders in the life of people. At the sight of His presence during the marriage at Cana in Galilee, they knew they could not be embarrassed. The Name of Jesus puts an end to all forms of harassment, lack and disgrace. When His Name is at work in your life, you can never be a victim of situations and circumstances. His Name is a seal of authority upon all our blessings.\r"
"Departing from the Lord"," morning star","""2016-06-09T17:10:43.877Z""","""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z""","And Cain said to the LORD, ""My punishment is too great to bear!\r
\r
""Behold, Thou hast driven me this day from the face of the ground; and from Thy face I shall be hidden, and I shall be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth, and it will come about that whoever finds me will kill me."" \r
\r
So the LORD said to him, ""Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold."" And the LORD appointed a sign for Cain, lest anyone finding him should slay him. \r
\r
Then Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden (Genesis 4:13-16).\r
\r
When the Lord told Cain how he could be delivered from depression he did not listen. When we do not heed the Lord, it will usually result in our falling even further into sin, just as it did with Cain. Cain still could have turned to the Lord, humbled himself, and repented, and he would have received help. The Lord warned him that he had to master the sin, but he continued down the path of letting his sin master him.\r
\r
It is interesting that, even then, Cain understood the law of sowing and reaping, which Paul explained in Galatians 6:7: ""Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap."" He knew that because he had murdered his brother, he was in danger of being murdered himself. This is a law that is as sure as the law of gravity. Therefore, if we want to receive grace, we should learn to sow grace every chance that we get. If we want to receive mercy, we should learn to sow mercy every chance we get. If we do good, we will reap good. If we do evil, we will reap the same.\r
\r
When reading about Cain's fear of being murdered, one might think, ""Who is going to murder him?"" Adam and Eve lived nearly one thousand years. They did begin to fulfil their commission to multiply and fill the earth, having many other sons and daughters. Obviously, there was already a population on the earth by the time Cain slew Abel. They were obviously close relatives to Cain, but he was still afraid of them. He had slain his own brother, so he knew that a brother could slay him. This was accurate enough, because all men ultimately derive their name from the same family, but that has never kept them from attacking one another.\r
\r
Even so, the Lord had mercy on Cain. He gave him a mark that would serve to protect him. Throughout the history of God's dealings with mankind, He has been quick to show unmerited grace and mercy to us. His grace and mercy is even enough for Him to negate the law of sowing and reaping. Throughout the Scriptures, we have many examples of the Lord causing crop failures from the evil seeds men have sown. However, we also have examples of swift judgement for those who have hardened their hearts and presumed upon His grace and mercy.\r
\r
The worst result of Cain's sin of murdering his brother was that he ""went out from the presence of the Lord."" When fighting occurs between brethren in churches, or between churches, this is often the ultimate result. Many will end up actually departing from the Lord. That is why from the very beginning, one of the enemy's primary strategies has been to get brothers to fight with each other. He is called ""the accuser of our brethren"" (see Revelation 12:10), because one of his most effective weapons against us is to get us accusing one another.\r
\r
Cain somehow thought that Abel was the reason for his rejection. The rejection of Cain's offering had nothing to do with Abel's offering. The answer to Cain's problem had nothing to do with Abel, but with himself. However, from the beginning, blaming someone else for our own problems has been one of the primary deceptions that has kept men from the grace of God. It has also led to the most destructive wars in history, and it has led to the most destructive wars between churches in history.\r
\r
First, the enemy will try to get us to be jealous of others. Then he will get us to accuse them of being the reason for our own problems. That is why nations that are having serious difficulties become so dangerous. It often seems much easier to blame someone else and attack them instead of dealing with our own problems. People will tend to rally around us if we can portray a common enemy that is causing our problems. Churches and people can become dangerous when they start having serious problems. If you see them starting to attack and blame others, it is time to depart. We must not continue to get caught in this trap of the enemy, which is the seemingly cheap escape from dealing with our own shortcomings. It will lead us to needlessly wounding others. Even worse than that, it will also lead us to ""departing from the presence of the Lord."

If you believe that you have received when you pray, you will get it. If you have doubts when you pray (will God give it to me?), you will get nothing. And remember Jesus told us to pray that way. You have only one choice today – to be obedient and trust Him with no doubts."

In my many years of ministering, I have sadly seen many lives wasted and destines destroyed by the devil and his agents. While some are looking up to God for healing, others are looking for deliverance from satanic afflictions, and some are struggling from self and sin. The Name of Jesus is a universal cure for all problems. If you believe in Jesus, no matter how hopeless your situation and condition maybe, there will be a supernatural intervention in your life.\r
\r
Every believer carries a measure of God’s glory. However, as we walk with God, we realise that the glory of God is in different phases, and God expects us to move from one level of glory to another consistently. In Christ, there is only a starting point but there is no end to the activation of His glory and wonders in our lives. All we need to do is believe Him and follow as He leads. Prayer precedes penetration into certain realms of God’s glory. Performing wonders is easy when the glory of God saturates our lives."

They are new every morning; great and abundant is Your stability and faithfulness.\r
—Lamentations 3:22-23 AMPC\r
\r
Aren't you thankful for God's abundant mercy? it is new every morning. Surely we would all live miserable, defeated lives if it were not for His compassion and willingness to forgive us. \r
\r
When we meditate on God's mercy and truly realise how much He willingly forgives us, we can much more easily show mercy to others. Good relationships are impossible unless we are generous with mercy and forgiveness. Being merciful simply means forgiving others even though their actions would warrant our anger. \r
\r
Jesus said that we are to forgive our enemies and be kind. In this way, we show ourselves to be like our Father in heaven, for He is merciful and kind. \r
\r
God's mercy is new every morning, and I am glad—because I am sure I use my allotted portion every day. I am grateful for a new, fresh start each day. When we make mistakes, He does not want us to try to sacrifice to make up for them. When others hurt or offend us, He wants us to extend mercy to them. \r
\r
Learn to give and receive mercy regularly, and let mercy become a way of life for you. \r
\r
Love Others Today: God's mercies are new for you right now! Receive the mercy He has for you and extends mercy to everyone around you."

When God gives you a vision for your life, it’ll burn within you like a fire that can’t be extinguished. The psalmist said, ‘My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned.’ So, what lights your fire? What burns ‘hot’ within you? When God calls you to do something, He creates within you both the desire to do it and the power to carry it out. Though you feel inadequate and unqualified, stand on His Word: ‘For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases Him.’ (Philippians 2:13 NLT) Mahatma Gandhi had a vision of a free and independent India at a time when it was governed by the British. Henry Ford had a vision of every family in America owning an automobile at a time when people were frightened of his new invention. Daniel K. Ludwig had a vision of a self-supporting industrial region in the heart of the Brazilian jungle at a time when there was no industry, no electricity, and no city of any kind for hundreds of kilometres. Where do such creative desires come from? God, Who is our Creator! And when God gives you a wide-blue-sky mindset, you’ll never be happy living in a mental birdcage. Are there times when you’ll feel afraid and uncertain about what to do? Yes! Fear and faith are two sides of the same coin, and they’ll always be part of your thinking. But the one you choose is the one that’ll determine your future—and you get to choose!\r

Perhaps you’re wondering, ‘What am I supposed to do with my life? What’s my purpose here?’ God answers these questions through our abilities. He leads us to our life’s purpose through the skills and talents He has given us. God-given gifts are the skills a person easily performs, often without formal training. We derive great pleasure from doing what we’re naturally good at doing. So if you aren’t sure of your life’s purpose, just do what you do well and watch God confirm it by blessing your endeavours. Don’t spend your time trying to do what you’re not gifted to do, or what somebody else is good at. We know we’re operating in our gifts and calling when what we do ministers life to others. If what we do makes us miserable and fills us with a sense of dread, usually we’re not in God’s perfect will. He gives us peace and joy to let us know we’re fulfilling His perfect plan: ‘For you shall go out with joy, and be led out with peace.’ Look at what you enjoy, what you’re good at, and what God is giving you the grace to do—then let God be God in your life. He wants to flow through you, and it may not be in the same way as He flows through others. Trust His ability in and through you, and don’t be afraid to be unique. God has a specific place and a specific plan for each of us. How will you know you’re in the right place fulfilling His plan? You will have peace!\r

"The winning strategy 1","Vision Christian media","""2016-06-09T17:10:43.879Z""","""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z""","‘Love never fails.’ 1 Corinthians 13:8 NIV\r
The Bible says, ‘Love never fails.’ Think about it: money doesn’t bring happiness, fame doesn’t bring self-worth, and revenge doesn’t bring satisfaction. The only thing that never fails is love. When Mother Teresa addressed world leaders at the United Nations, she was asked, ‘How can we have world peace?’ She replied, ‘Go home and love your family.’ If we all did that, ‘Paradise Lost’ would become ‘Paradise Found’! Napoleon Bonaparte’s intellectual greatness and intense egotism make his alleged tribute to the supremacy of leadership by love all the more striking. He said, ‘Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne and I myself founded great empires: but upon what did the creations of our genius depend? Upon force. Jesus alone founded His empire upon love, and to this day millions would die for Him.’ Sometimes leaders are just power-holders. Because you can’t love others without making yourself vulnerable, they see expressing love as a weakness. But the fact is you can’t love and ‘keep all your options open’. To truly love—whether it’s your spouse, your children, or the people you lead—you must give yourself unreservedly in such a way that you can be hurt and even rejected. The fundamental principle on which power-holders operate is to protect themselves and everything they have. Whereas the fundamental principle of true leadership is to give of yourself with no holds barred. Love as an intrinsic characteristic of leadership seems outmoded, yet according to Scripture it’s still the winning strategy. The Bible says, ‘God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.’ (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV) That’s why love is the winning strategy.\r

"Live Like Royalty","Wisdom for the day","""2016-06-09T17:10:43.879Z""","""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z""","""And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."" Revelation 1:6 (KJV)\r
 \r
You are royalty. You have been made kings and priests unto God. The reason the devil runs roughshod over you is because you have refused to understand this fact and to behave like royalty. There are environments in which you can't find a worldly prince because he is royalty. There are ways in which he can't talk. There are movies he can't watch because he does not want his mind to be twisted. There is music he does not listen to. There are books he will not read. He lives his life by virtue of who he is. He lives his life conscious of the fact that he is royalty. Because he is born royalty, others will train him and guide him to live the life of royalty. He is uncommon, so he can't function like a common man.\r
 \r
The word 'common' means ordinary, inferior, lacking distinction, mean, low, lacking in rank, and not exceptional. Why would you function like a common man when God has elevated you? Ephesians 2:4-6 (KJV) says, ""But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) And hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus"".\r
 \r
For too long the church has been a misrepresentation of royalty. That is why it appears as if we don't have the authority to declare things and have them carried out. Because the devil says, ""What do you mean, you are like me? What right do you have to tell me what to do? There is no difference between us. You live like me."" Child of God, you are royalty! So stop living life frivolously. Take responsibility for your life. You are the extension of God in your world. You are His righteousness. You are His beloved. Square up your shoulders, knowing who you are. It's your assignment. Understand that you are royalty and live like royalty.\r
